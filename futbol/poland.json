The club was founded in 1910 and initially called TMRF Widzew, referring to the Widzew-district of Łódź.

In 1922 the club transformed into Robotnicze Towarzystwo Sportowe Widzew (Workers' Sports Society Widzew).\r\n\r\nWidzew has won four Polish league championships (in 1981, 1982, 1996 and 1997) and the 1985 Polish Cup.\r\n\r\nThey have appeared in 117 matches in European Cups, of which they won 42.

However, Widzew became champion that year, and were allowed to stay in the second division, which was renamed First League (I liga) before the start of the 2008-2009 season. Despite the deduction of six points as a penalty, Widzew managed to become champions once again, and were finally promoted to the Ekstraklasa. In total, Widzew played 35 seasons at the highest level before being relegated in the 2013-2014 season.\r\n\r\nDue to financial problems, Widzew finished last at the end of the 2014–15 I Liga season. Subsequently, the club ruled by Sylwester Cacek went bankrupt.\r\n\r\nIn consequence local businessmen led by Marcin Ferdzyn and Grzegorz Waranecki decided to take on amateur status as a new association called Stowarzyszenie Reaktywacja Tradycji Sportowych Widzew Łódź (Association of the Reactivation of the Sports Traditions of Widzew Łódź), which continues the tradition of the old RTS Widzew Łódź. The new association was registered in a Polish court on 2.07.2015, and within a few weeks of summer 2015 they managed to find new coach Witold Obarek and collect a new squad, which started the 2015\/2016 season in the fifth tier of Polish football.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Poland","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/flqteh1511517925.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"138907","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"3497","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Wigry Suwałki","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1947","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Polish I liga","idLeague":"4661","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Stadion Miejski","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/39a3hh1580749208.jpg","strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"Suwałki, Podlaskie Voivodeship, Poland","intStadiumCapacity":"3000","strWebsite":"","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Wigry Suwałki is a Polish football club based in Suwałki, Podlaskie Voivodeship.

Its name commemorates a legendary Polish 15th-century knight, Zawisza Czarny (Zawisza the Black). The club holds many sections: football, track and field athletics, boxing, rowing, canoeing, weightlifting, gymnastics, shooting, and parachuting ones.\r\n\r\nThe team was founded in 1946, as a military-sponsored club in Koszalin, although they only played friendly matches initially. When the army headquarters moved to Bydgoszcz a year later in 1947 the club followed.\r\n\r\nThe football team has achieved some successes, playing for several years in the Polish First Division, first winning promotion in 1961.\r\n\r\nThey reached the semi-finals of the Polish Cup in 1991 and competed in 1993 Intertoto Cup.\r\n\r\nZawisza was relegated from the Second Level to Fourth Level in the 1997–98 season. In 2001, they controversially merged with Chemik Bydgoszcz, and played as Chemik-Zawisza, whilst the reserve team was initially meant to be called Zawisza-Chemik, although ultimately the reserved team remained as simply \"Zawisza\". The merger turned out to be very unsuccessful, and the senior side started anew from the bottom of the league pyramid reverting to \"Chemik\", leaving the reserve team in the fifth division, which subsequently became Zawisza's senior team.\r\n\r\nAside from the ongoing Hydrobudowa scandal between 2006 and 2008, the original team were promoted to the Third Level after finishing 1st in their regional Group of the 3rd liga in the 2007–2008 season. On 12 June 2011, after a 13-year absence, Zawisza was promoted to the Second Division after finishing second 5 points behind Olimpia Grudziądz in the Third Division West in the 2010–11 season. In 2013 Zawisza won the Polish Second Division and were promoted.\r\n\r\nThey won the Polish Cup in the 2013–14 season, 6–5 on penalties after a goalless 120 minutes against Zagłębie Lubin, and qualified to UEFA Europe League second qualifying round.\r\n\r\nAfter the club had finished 5th in 2015–16 I liga, it did not receive a license for the following season due to financial problems and dissolved. The refounded club SP Zawisza started the 2016-17 season in Klasa B, grupa Bydgoszcz III which is in the 8th tier of Polish football.\r\n\r\nZawisza's under-19 team won the national youth championship in 1981.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Poland","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/s2uuvd1511516738.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/rpspwy1423836553.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
