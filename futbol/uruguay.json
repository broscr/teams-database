Although its main focus is football, the club hosts many other activities including basketball, futsal, tennis, cycling, volleyball and chess.\r\n\r\nIn domestic tournaments, Nacional won the Primera División title 46 times, being the 2016 season its last title won. Domestic cups honours include Copa de Competencia (8 times) and Copa de Honor (7 times), among others.\r\n\r\nAt international level, Nacional has won 21 titles, nine of them recognised by FIFA and CONMEBOL that include three Copa Libertadores. In this tournament, Nacional is the all-time leader with 553 points. Nacional also won three Copa Intercontinental, becoming the first unbeaten three times world champion. In addition, Nacional is the only Uruguayan team that won the Copa Interamericana (two times) and the Recopa Sudamericana, competition in which is the first champion (1989). Besides, Nacional won four Copa de Honor Cousenier, three Copa Aldao two Tie Cup, and one Copa Escobar-Gerona, all of them organized by Argentine and Uruguayan Associations together.\r\n\r\nNacional is identified with the white, blue and red colours inspired by the flag of Uruguay's national hero José Gervasio Artigas. In spite of hosting some games at the Montevideo's city property Estadio Centenario, Nacional plays most of its home matches at the Parque Central, located in the La Blanqueada neighbourhood and popularly known as El Parque, where on 13 July 1930 Belgium and the United States played one of the two opening games of the 1930 FIFA World Cup, and where Argentina and Brazil, among others, made their debut in FIFA World Cup. Besides, Parque Central was the only venue in the 1923 and 1924 edition of the Copa América.\r\n\r\nNacional has fierce rivalries with many clubs, notably with cross-town team Peñarol, in clashes known as El clásico del fútbol uruguayo.\r\n\r\nAccording to CONMEBOL, Nacional was the Uruguayan team with the best international performance in the 2007–2012 period. Also, according to IFFHS, it was the best Uruguayan team of the 2001–2012 period and the tenth of the continent.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, Nacional reached 60,000 associates","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Uruguay","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/4sqhs81581352643.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2017-135364-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCN4JBah1YUV9Qd8iQmjNq3Q","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"135369","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"2348","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Peñarol","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Club Atlético Peñarol","intFormedYear":"1891","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Uruguayan Primera Division","idLeague":"4432","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Estadio Campeón del Siglo","strKeywords":"Manyas","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/xvc9xd1514058919.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Estadio Campeón del Siglo is a football stadium located in Bañados de Carrasco, Montevideo, Uruguay, and the home ground of Peñarol, who plays in the First Division.
