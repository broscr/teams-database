Named after another Czech football club which owned the ground, the stadium was called České srdce (\"Czech heart\") ground. Largely destroyed during World War II, each of the four stands has been reconstructed several times since. The stadium was renamed Franz-Horr-Stadion in honour of the Wiener Fußball-Verband's (Vienna Football Association) president Franz Horr who died in 1974.\r\n\r\nThe latest renovation was the complete reconstruction of the East Stand in 2008. It is now a transformable standing\/seating two-tier stand. After these modifications, the stadium's maximum capacity is now 17,656.\r\n\r\nIn January 2011, the stadium was renamed Generali Arena, as part of a sponsorship deal between FK Austria Wien and the insurance group Generali. Since UEFA does not recognize sponsored stadium names, the venue is referred to as Viola Park in European competitions, including in their upcoming stage of 2020 UEFA Women's Champions League Final.","strStadiumLocation":"Vienna, Austria","intStadiumCapacity":"17565","strWebsite":"www.fk-austria.at","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/fkaustria","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/FKAustriaWien","strInstagram":"instagram.com\/fkaustriawien","strDescriptionEN":"Fußballklub Austria Wien (German pronunciation: ; known in English as Austria Vienna, and usually shortened to Austria in German-speaking countries), is an Austrian association football club from the capital city of Vienna.
