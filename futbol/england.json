Telford United is a football club based in Telford, Shropshire, England. The club was formed in 2004 after the original Telford United, founded in 1872, folded due to financial problems. Currently members of the National League North, the sixth tier of English football, they play home matches at the New Bucks Head in Wellington, part of the new town of Telford. Their colours are white with navy blue and red trim.\r\n\r\nTelford United, then playing in the Football Conference, experienced severe financial difficulties towards the end of the 2003–04 season following the collapse of the Miras Contracts business of chairman and sole shareholder Andy Shaw. The club went into administration, and although supporters raised around £50,000 in two months, the club's debts totalled over £4 million, resulting in liquidation on 27 May 2004. On the same day, Telford United Supporters Limited announced that a new club would be formed, which was named A.F.C. Telford United; a new club motto, numquam obliviscere (never forget) was also adopted. In June the new club were placed in Division One of the Northern Premier League by the Football Association. Bernard McNally was appointed as manager and a new squad assembled.\r\n\r\nThe new club's first season saw them finish third in Division One, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After beating Eastwood Town 1–0 in the semi-final, they defeated Kendal Town 2–1 in the final to earn promotion to the Premier Division. The attendance of 4,215 for the final was a club record. The following season saw them finish tenth. During the season, McNally was replaced as manager by Rob Smith. In 2006–07 the club finished third, having missed the chance to win the league when they lost 2–1 at home to eventual champions Burscough on the final day; the attendance of 5,710 being a new club record. However, they qualified for the promotion play-offs, and a 2–0 win over Marine in the semi-final, they defeated Witton Albion 3–1 to earn promotion to the Conference North.\r\n\r\nTelford finished second in the Conference North in 2007–08, again qualifying for the playoffs, in which they lost 4–0 on aggregate to Barrow. The 2008–09 season resulted in a fourth-place finish and another play-off campaign. After beating Alfreton Town 5–4 on aggregate in the semi-finals (a 2–0 win at home and a 4–3 defeat away), they lost 1–0 to Gateshead. The season also saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, where they were drawn at home to Football League club Southend United. Following a 2–2 draw, the club lost 2–0 in the replay. In the FA Trophy they reached the semi-finals, losing 4–2 on aggregate to York City. However, they were victorious in the Conference League Cup, beating Forest Green Rovers 3–0 on penalties after a 0–0 draw.\r\n\r\nIn 2009–10 Telford finished eleventh in the league, resulting in the sacking of Smith and his replacement with Andy Sinton. Sinton's first season saw them finish as runners-up again. In the play-offs they defeated Nuneaton Town 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-final, before beating Guiseley 3–2 in the final with an injury-time winner by Phil Trainer, earning promotion to the Conference National. They also reached the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 3–1 at home to Lincoln City.\r\n\r\nThe 2011–12 season saw Telford finish twentieth, one place above the relegation zone. Another appearance in the first round of the FA Cup resulted in a 4–0 defeat at Chelmsford City. Sinton left the club mid-way through the following season, and was replaced by Mark Cooper, who remained in charge for only six games, before resigning to take a coaching role at Swindon Town. He was replaced by Graham Hyde, who lasted just two games, resigning after a defeat to Macclesfield Town. John Psaras took over for the remainder of the season, which saw them finish bottom of the division and be relegated to the Conference North. Liam Watson was appointed as manager in May 2013.\r\n\r\nIn 2013–14 Telford won the Conference North, earning an immediate return to the Conference Premier. However, the following season Watson was sacked in December with the club bottom of the division and replaced by Steve Kittrick. They finished 23rd, resulting in relegation back to the North division. However, the season also saw them reach the second round of the FA Cup for the first time; after beating Basingstoke Town 2–1 in a first round replay, they lost 1–0 at Bristol City. In August 2015 Kittrick was sacked and Rob Smith returned for a second spell as manager. They reached the first round of the FA Cup again in 2017–18 but lost 1–0 at Hereford.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/t3su0b1579174734.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134401","idSoccerXML":"859","idAPIfootball":"1818","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Aldershot","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Aldershot Town","intFormedYear":"1992","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English National League","idLeague":"4590","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Recreation Ground","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"www.theshots.co.uk","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Aldershot Town Football Club is an English association football club based in Aldershot, Hampshire.

They competed in Football League Two from 2008 to 2013 but were relegated from the Football League at the end of the 2012–13 season. Aldershot Town entered administration on 2 May 2013.\r\n\r\nIn March 1992, the town of Aldershot was without a football club after Aldershot F.C. became the first Football League team to fold during the football season since Accrington Stanley in 1962. Aldershot Town was born later the same year, and began life competing in the Isthmian League Division Three. Despite Aldershot Town playing five divisions lower than the Football League, the attendance for their first competitive fixture was higher than the old team's last home tie. Ten successive victories were recorded under the guidance of former player Steve Wignall and Aldershot won the championship by an 18-point margin.\r\n\r\nA further promotion and an FA Vase quarter-final placing was achieved in the 1993–94 season. When Steve Wignall departed to take charge of Colchester United mid-way through the 1994–95 season, former Nottingham Forest winger Steve Wigley took over. The club finished the 1994–95 season with a run of six successive victories, but missed out on promotion by goal difference. After narrowly missing out during the next two seasons Wigley left in July 1997 to become Youth Development Officer at Nottingham Forest. He was replaced by George Borg. Attendances continued to rise during this period and the final fixture of the 1997–98 Isthmian League First Division championship-winning season, at home to Berkhamsted Town, attracted 4,289 people to the Recreation Ground – a league record. The success under Borg continued with an Isthmian League Cup, two Hampshire Senior Cups and a runners-up spot in the Isthmian League Premier Division.\r\n\r\nThe club's reserves were reinstated in 2000–01 and entered the Suburban League. The FA Cup in 2000–01 saw Aldershot take on league opposition at The Recreation Ground for the first time since reforming, when Brighton & Hove Albion visited for a 1st Round tie in November and a record attendance of 7,500 saw the league team win. In the following season's FA Cup the Shots held Bristol Rovers to a home draw in the First Round, but again missed out on the Second Round after losing the replay in Bristol.\r\n\r\nGeorge Borg resigned as manager in November 2001 after pressure from supporters and was replaced by Terry Brown. He won his first game in charge beating Newport IOW 1–0 in the Hampshire Senior Cup Semi-final Second Leg, taking The Shots on to win the final against Havant & Waterlooville. In Brown's first full season in charge he overhauled the squad, and by mid-November the Shots were top of the table, a position they did not relinquish for the remainder of the season, winning promotion to the Football Conference. The club also retained the Hampshire Senior Cup with a 2–1 win over Bashley.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/eivz7o1488798658.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134631","idSoccerXML":"1094","idAPIfootball":"4677","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Alfreton Town","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1959","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English National League North","idLeague":"4681","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"North Street","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"North Street also known as the Impact Arena is a football stadium in Alfreton, Derbyshire.

Inoltre è una delle tredici squadre che hanno raggiunto le finali di tutte le tre principali competizioni gestite dalla UEFA: Champions League (2005-2006), Coppa UEFA (1999-2000) e Coppa delle Coppe (1979-1980, 1993-1994 e 1994-1995).[6]\r\n\r\nI colori sociali, rosso per la maglietta e bianco per i pantaloncini, hanno subìto variazioni più o meno evidenti nel corso degli anni. Anche la sede del club è stata cambiata più volte: inizialmente la squadra giocava a Woolwich, ma nel 1913 si spostò all'Arsenal Stadium, nel quartiere di Highbury; dal 2006 disputa invece le sue partite casalinghe nel nuovo Emirates Stadium. Lo stemma è stato modificato ripetutamente, ma al suo interno è sempre comparso almeno un cannone. Proprio per questo motivo i giocatori ed i tifosi dell'Arsenal sono spesso soprannominati Gunners (in italiano \"cannonieri\").\r\n\r\nL'Arsenal conta su una schiera di tifosi molto nutrita, distribuita in ogni parte del mondo. Nel corso degli anni sono sorte profonde rivalità con i sostenitori di club concittadini, la più sentita delle quali è quella con i seguaci del Tottenham Hotspur, con i quali i Gunners giocano regolarmente il North London derby.[7] L'Arsenal è anche uno dei club più ricchi del mondo, con un patrimonio stimato di 1,3 miliardi di dollari, secondo la rivista Forbes nel 2014, facendone il quinto club più ricco del pianeta e il secondo in Inghilterra.[8]","strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/a1af2i1557005128.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133604-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/q2mxlz1512644512.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/xyusxr1419347566.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qttspr1419347612.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/uwssqx1420884450.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qtprsw1420884964.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/rtpsrr1419351049.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/ArsenalTour","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"137301","idSoccerXML":"4990","idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Arsenal U21","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":null,"intFormedYear":null,"strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"_No League","idLeague":"4367","strDivision":null,"strManager":null,"strStadium":"","strKeywords":null,"strRSS":null,"strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":null,"intStadiumCapacity":null,"strWebsite":"","strFacebook":null,"strTwitter":null,"strInstagram":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":null,"strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134410","idSoccerXML":"870","idAPIfootball":"7693","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Ashton","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1878","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English Northern Premier League Premier Division","idLeague":"4646","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Hurst Cross","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"The club initially played at Holebottom on Smallshaw, before moving to Rosehill and then to Hurst Cross in 1880, making the ground one of the oldest football venues in the world.

They are currently members of the Northern Premier League Premier Division and play at Hurst Cross.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1878 as Hurst Football Club and the earliest known match report dates back to a game against Hurst Red Star on 16 March 1879. They originally played in black-and-white stripes and were nicknamed the Lambs. The club first entered the FA Cup in 1883, beating Turton 3–1 in the first round, and then Irwell Springs 3–2 in the second. However, the result was annulled after a protest from Irwell, and it was they who advanced to the third round after Hurst refused to play the replay. In 1885 they won the first edition of the Manchester Senior Cup, beating Newton Heath (now Manchester United) 3–0 in the final. In the same year they reached the second round of the FA Cup again. However, although they defeated Halliwell 3–1, the result was annulled again. Ashton refused to play the replay and Halliwell advanced to the third round.\r\n\r\nThey joined the Ashton & District League in 1891, but after finishing ninth in the league in the 1891–92 season, it was reported in June 1892 that the club had folded. They were reformed in 1909, and were admitted to the Manchester League as it was expanded from 16 to 18 clubs. In their first season in the league, they finished level on points at the top of the table with Salford United, resulting in a play-off for the championship, which Salford won 2–1.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing sixth in 1910–11, Hurst won the title in 1911–12 and subsequently joined Division Two of the Lancashire Combination. Although they only finished fifth in 1912–13, they were promoted to Division One of the league for the 1913–14 season. Due to the outbreak of World War I, the club did not compete in 1915–16, but re-entered a wartime edition of the league for the 1916–17 season, winning the title. However, they did not compete during the following season. They resumed in the Lancashire Combination in 1918–19, but switched to the Cheshire County League in 1923. Players started wearing red shirts, earning the club a new nickname – the Robins.\r\n\r\nShortly before World War II, the club signed Dixie Dean, but the outbreak of hostilities limited him to a handful of appearances for the club. Following the war, the club resumed playing in the Cheshire County League for the 1945–46 season, changing their name to Ashton United on 1 February 1947. Despite finishing second bottom of the league in 1946–47, they applied for election to the Football League, but the four Football League clubs were re-elected without a vote being taken. They subsequently rejoined the Lancashire Combination in 1948 and were placed in Division One.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing twelfth in 1960–61, the club resigned from the league in order to apply to rejoin the Cheshire County League; in a ballot, they defeated by Altrincham and Wigan Athletic, and so had to rejoin the Lancashire Combination. However, Division One was now full, so the club had to drop into Division Two, which they won in 1961–62 to earn promotion back to Division One.\r\n\r\nIn 1964 the club switched to the Midland Counties League, where they played for two seasons before moving back to Division Two of the Lancashire Combination in 1966. Two seasons later, they moved across to the Cheshire County League, where they remained until it merged with the Lancashire Combination to form the North West Counties League in 1982. The club were placed in Division One of the new league, but were relegated to Division Two after finishing second-from-bottom in 1983–84. After winning Division Two in 1987–88 they were promoted back to Division One.\r\n\r\nThe 1991–92 season saw the club win the Division One title, earning promotion to Division One of the Northern Premier League. They remained in the division until a third-place finish in 2001–02 saw them qualify for the promotion play-offs. After a 3–1 win over Spennymoor United in the semi-finals, a 2–1 win over Bamber Bridge in the final saw them promoted to the Premier Division. During the season, Ashton's Gareth Morris scored one of the fastest goals in FA Cup history, netting after only four seconds against Skelmersdale United.\r\n\r\nWith the creation of the Conference North in 2004, a 14th-place finish in 2003–04 saw the club play-off against Hyde United and Bradford Park Avenue for the right to play in the new league. Following a 2–1 win over Hyde, they lost 2–1 to Bradford Park Avenue in the final. However, after Hucknall Town were denied promotion due to ground grading issues, Ashton took their place in the Conference North. The following season saw them finish second-from-bottom, resulting in relegation back to the Northern Premier League's Premier Division. In 2010 the club were ordered to pay £32,000 to Marcus Hallows after he was injured playing against Ashton for Altrincham.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 the club won the Northern Premier League Challenge Cup, beating Northwich Victoria 1–0 in the final. After finishing fifth in 2013–14 the club qualified for the promotion play-offs; however, after beating FC United 2–1 after extra time, they lost the final to AFC Fylde on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The 2014–15 season saw a third-place finish, again qualifying for the promotion play-offs, in which they lost on penalties to local rivals Curzon Ashton after a 1–1 draw. A third consecutive play-off campaign followed a fourth-place finish in 2015–16, but saw the club lose 3–1 to Salford City in the semi-finals.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/q23yt61511609306.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133601","idSoccerXML":"5","idAPIfootball":"66","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Aston Villa","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Aston Villa FC","intFormedYear":"1874","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English Premier League","idLeague":"4328","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Villa Park","strKeywords":"Villa, The Villa, The Villans and The Lions","strRSS":"http:\/\/www.football365.com\/aston-villa\/rss","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/uwyqtq1420238705.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Villa Park is a football stadium in the district of Witton, Birmingham, England, with a seating capacity of 42,682.

Over the course of its history the stadium has gone through various stages of renovation and development, resulting in the current stand configuration of the Holte End, Trinity Road Stand, North Stand and the Doug Ellis Stand. The club has initial planning permission to redevelop the North Stand, which will increase the capacity of Villa Park from 42,682 to approximately 50,000.\r\n\r\nBefore 1914 a cycling track ran around the perimeter of the pitch where regular cycling meetings were hosted as well as athletic events. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen various concerts staged along with other sporting events including boxing matches and international rugby league and rugby union matches. In 1999, the last ever final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup took place at Villa Park.

Prior to this the Adders had gained national recognition by reaching the semi-final of the FA Amateur Cup in both 1907 and 1909. After several decades of varying performance, the 1947–48 season saw the Adders claim the Birmingham Combination League and Cup double. In 1954 they stepped up to the Birmingham and District League (later renamed the West Midlands (Regional) League), where they were runners-up in 1972 and moved up to the Southern League. In their first season they gained promotion to the Premier Division, where their best position was third in 1973–74, but the club was forced into liquidation in the summer of 1979.\r\n\r\nA group of local enthusiasts managed to fulfil the team's reserve fixtures in the West Midlands League under the name Atherstone United and then decided to continue under that name as a new club.\r\n\r\nIn 1982 the new club won promotion to the West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division, followed in 1986–87 by winning the Premier Division title and promotion to the Southern League Midland Division. Two years later they were promoted again, to the Southern League Premier Division, where they finished as high as 4th. However, the end of the 1999–00 season saw Atherstone relegated for the first time in either incarnation.

In the 2007–08 season, the club won promotion again as champions of the Midland Football Alliance, the club's third promotion in four seasons. The first season in the Southern League Midland Division saw the Adders in the top three for most of the season. At the end they finished third behind champions Leamington and near neighbours Nuneaton Town. They made the play-offs, only to lose to Chasetown. They did however win the GX Southern League Cup for the first time after beating Bridgwater Town in the two legged final.\r\n\r\nDue to financial problems, the club had to resign from the Southern League mid-way during the 2010–11 season.

The highest league period in the club's history was to be short-lived and a return to Division 4 came after relegation in 1969–70 season. Fortunes never improved and at the end of the 1971–72 season, after an unsuccessful bid for re-election, Barrow were voted out of the Football League, to be replaced by Hereford United of the Southern League. Barrow have since spent their time in the top two levels of non-league football, having been promoted five times to the Conference (of which they were a founder member), most recently as Conference North champions in 2014–15. In addition they have twice won non-league football's most prestigious cup competition, the FA Trophy – in 1990 and 2010, becoming the only club to have won the Trophy at both old and new Wembley Stadium.\r\nThe club colours are blue and white, though the combination of these has varied over time, leading to their nickname \"The Bluebirds\". Attendances at the club's Holker Street ground vary – the home record of 16,874 was set against Swansea Town in the FA Cup Third Round in 1954 – but during the 1990s and 2000s the average remained consistently between 800 and 1,500. Average attendance stood at 1456 during the 2014–15 season.

In 1970 the club moved to New Lodge, which had previously been a sports ground used by Outwell Common Football Club. The ground was enclosed using a loan from Basildon Borough Council and Charrington Brewery and dressing rooms and a clubhouse were built. During the 1970s a covered standing area was built on the clubhouse side of the pitch, which became known as the Cowshed. Temporary seated stands loaned from Essex County Cricket Club were later installed on the other side of the pitch. In 1977 the club won a set of floodlights by winning the Philips Electrical Floodlight Competition final against Friar Lane Old Boys, a six-a-side tournament played at the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre the day after their FA Vase final against Sheffield. The floodlights were inaugurated with a friendly match against West Ham United, which attracted a then-record crowd of 3,841.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 a permanent 120-seat stand was built between the Cowshed and the clubhouse; its shape led to it becoming known as the Pacman stand. During the 1980s a 200-seat stand was built on the side that had previously hosted the temporary seating, with the supporters club erecting several small areas of terracing. In 1995 Billericay bought two stands that had been in use at Newbury Town's Faraday Road ground after the club went bust. One was installed next to the Cowshed and the other at the Blunts Wall End, with seats later installed in the Blunts Wall End stand. The new stand adjacent to the Cowshed was soon moved to the other end of the pitch. An area of covered terracing was added alongside the 200-seat stand. Chelmsford City groundshared at New Lodge between 1998 and 2005. In 2002 the club announced plans to move to a new 4,000-capacity stadium at Gloucester Park. However, the relocation was scrapped by new chairman Steve Kent in 2004. By the summer of 2017 the ground had a capacity of 3,500, of which 424 was seated and 2,000 was covered.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2017 New Lodge was completely redeveloped. Covered terraces were built at both ends of the ground covering the full width of the pitch; a new seated stand was built next to the clubhouse where the Pacman stand and Cowshed had previously been located, and was named the Harry Parker Stand. On the other side of the pitch the seating was extended to the full length of the pitch. The ground's capacity was raised to around 5,000 with 2,000 seated.

It has been the home ground of Birmingham City Football Club for more than a century.\r\n\r\nConstructed and opened in 1906 to replace the Muntz Street ground, which had become too small to meet the club's needs, the original St Andrew's could hold an estimated 75,000 spectators, housed in one grandstand and a large uncovered terrace. The attendance record, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341, was set at a 1939 FA Cup tie against Everton. During the Second World War, St Andrew's suffered bomb damage and the grandstand, housing a temporary fire station, burned down in an accidental fire. In the 1950s, the club replaced the stand and installed floodlights, and later erected a second small stand and roofed over the open terraces, but there were few further changes.\r\n\r\nThe ground became dilapidated: a boy was killed when a wall collapsed during rioting in the 1980s. When new owners took the club out of administration in 1993, they began a six-year redevelopment programme during which the ground was converted to an all-seater stadium to comply with the Taylor Report into safety at sports grounds, and all areas apart from the Main Stand were completely rebuilt. The seating capacity of the modern stadium is just over 30,000. It has function rooms suitable for business or social events and a club store selling Birmingham City merchandise. A 2004 proposal that the club should sell the ground and move into a multi-purpose City of Birmingham Stadium remains speculative. In 2013, the ground was listed as an Asset of Community Value under the Localism Act 2011.\r\n\r\nSt Andrew's has been the venue for England international football matches at all levels below the senior national team, and for semifinal matches in the FA Cup and finals of lesser competitions. It has played host to events in other sports, including rugby union and professional boxing, and more recently has staged music concerts.","strStadiumLocation":"Birmingham, England","intStadiumCapacity":"30016","strWebsite":"www.bcfc.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/BCFCofficial","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/bcfc","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/bcfcofficial\/?hl=en","strDescriptionEN":"Birmingham City Football Club (\/ˈbɜrmɪŋəm ˈsɪti\/, locally \/ˈbɜrmɪŋɡəm\/) is a professional association football club based in the city of Birmingham, England.

They compete in the Football League Championship, the second tier of league football in England.\r\n\r\nAs Small Heath, they played in the Football Alliance before becoming founder members and first ever champions of the Football League Second Division. The most successful period in their history was in the 1950s and early 1960s. They achieved their highest finishing position of sixth in the First Division in the 1955–56 season and reached the 1956 FA Cup Final, progressed to the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1960 and 1961, and won their first major trophy, the League Cup, in 1963, beating Aston Villa 3–1 on aggregate. They won the latter competition for the second time in 2011. They have played in the top tier of English football for the majority of their history.

The team competes in the Football League Championship from the 2012–13 season. They were relegated from the Premier League, the top tier of English football, at the end of the 2011–12 season. The club are currently managed by Gary Bowyer after previous manager Michael Appleton was dismissed on 19 March 2013. Appleton was the third manager to have lost his job in 6 months after Steve Kean and Henning Berg.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in 1875, becoming a founding member of The Football League in 1888. It is one of only three clubs to have been both a founder member of the Football League and the Premier League (the others being Aston Villa and Everton). In 1890 Rovers moved to its permanent home at Ewood Park. Prior to the formation of the Premier League in 1992, most of the club's successes were before 1930, when it had gained league and FA Cup trophies on several occasions. Relegation in 1965–66 was followed by 26 successive seasons of football outside the top flight.\r\n\r\nIn 1992, Blackburn gained promotion to the new Premier League a year after being taken over by local steel baron Jack Walker, who installed Kenny Dalglish as manager. In 1995, Blackburn became Premier League champions, having spent millions of pounds on players like Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton. However, the title-winning team was quickly split up and, in the 1998–99 season, the club was relegated. It was promoted back to the Premier League two years later, in the 2000–01 season, just after Walker's death. During this time it has qualified for the UEFA Cup four times: once as League Cup winners, twice as the Premier League's sixth-placed team and once via the Intertoto Cup. The 2009–10 season marked the club's 72nd non-consecutive year in the top flight.

It has been the permanent home of Blackpool F.C. since 1901 and is named after the road on which the stadium's main entrance used to stand. The stadium has been in a process of redevelopment since 2000. June of that year saw the demolition of the Spion Kop at the north end of the ground; an all-seated stand has now replaced it. The rebuilding of the West Stand was completed in August 2002. In March 2010, the South Stand, whose original structure was pulled down in 2003, was opened by Jimmy Armfield, the former Blackpool player for whom the stand is named. A temporary East Stand opened on 28 August 2010 with a capacity of 5,120 seats, initially increasing capacity to 16,220 with further hospitality seating in the South Stand to be installed later in the year. Bloomfield Road is ranked 45th in the list of English football stadiums by capacity and the third-smallest in the Championship.\r\n\r\nBefore moving to Bloomfield Road, Blackpool had called two other grounds home during their short existence. Firstly, between 1896 and 1897, they played their fifteen home Football League matches at Raikes Hall Gardens (also known as the Pleasure Gardens). In 1897, they moved to the Athletic Grounds at the present-day Stanley Park, which hosted thirty-two League matches over two seasons. After a short spell back at Raikes Hall Gardens in 1899, during their season out of the League, and again for all but the first home game of the 1900–01 campaign, Blackpool made the permanent move to Bloomfield Road.\r\n\r\nThe record attendance at the original Bloomfield Road was 38,098, which occurred when Blackpool played Wolverhampton Wanderers on 17 September 1955. The record at the reconstructed stadium is 16,116, which occurred for the visit of Manchester City on 17 October 2010. The record gate receipts for a home game is £72,949, for the FA Cup third-round tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 5 January 1991.\r\n\r\nThe stadium hosted three matches during the 2005 UEFA Women's Championship. It has also been the venue for the annual final of the Northern Rail Cup, a rugby league tournament, since 2005.\r\n\r\nThe club's mascot, who can be seen at every home game, is Bloomfield Bear. He replaced the long-serving Cable Cat, who was retired in June 2000.\r\n\r\nBetween 8 September 1900 and 28 December 2014, Blackpool have played 2,203 Football League games at Bloomfield Road. Between August 2010 and May 2011, they played nineteen Premier League games at the ground.

During that post-war period, Blackpool made three FA Cup Final appearances in six years and, during the 1950s, had four top-six finishes in the Football League First Division, their best position being runners-up to Manchester United in the 1955–56 season. In 1953, four Blackpool players were in the England team against Hungary at Wembley, causing the Daily Mirror to declare that \"Blackpool are playing Hungary today\", though England lost.

Bournemouth.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 Boscombe F.C. was given a piece of land by the town's Cooper-Dean family, after whom the ground was named. The land was the site of an old gravel pit, and the ground was not built in time for the start of the 1910–11 season. As a result, the club played at the adjacent King's Park until moving into Dean Court in December 1910. However, the club facilities were still not ready, and players initially had to change in a nearby hotel. Early developments at the ground included a 300-seat stand.\r\n\r\nIn 1923 the club were elected to Division Three South of the Football League, at which point they changed their name to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic. The first Football League match was played at Dean Court on 1 September 1923, with 7,000 watching a 0–0 draw with Swindon Town. Subsequent ground improvements were made following the purcase of fittings from the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, which allowed the construction of a 3,700-seat stand. A covered terrace was added at the southern end of the ground in 1936.\r\n\r\nThe club's record League attendance was set on 14 April 1948, when 25,495 watched a 1–0 defeat to QPR. The overall record attendance was set on 2 March 1957, when 28,799 spectators watched an FA Cup match against Manchester United. Shortly afterwards, a roof was added to the western stand. The club also purchased more land behind the northern end of the ground, with the intention of enlarging the stand and building a leisure centre. However, the club ran out of money during its construction and abandoned the scheme in 1984. As a result, the half-built structure was demolished and housing was built on that part of the site. The club's lowest Football League attendance was set on 4 March 1986, when only 1,873 saw a 2–2 drawn with Lincoln City.\r\n\r\nThe ground was completely rebuilt in 2001, with the pitch rotated ninety degrees from its original position and the ground moved away from adjacent housing. Because the work was not finished in time for the start of the 2001–02 season, Bournemouth played their first eight games at the Avenue Stadium in nearby Dorchester. When Dean Court reopened with a game against Wrexham on 10 November, it gained its first sponsored name, becoming the Fitness First Stadium. Although it was rebuilt as a three sided stadium with a capacity of 9,600, seats were placed on the undeveloped south end in the autumn of 2005. On 24 February 2004 Bournemouth's James Hayter scored the Football League's fastest-ever hat-trick at Dean Court, scoring three goals in 2 minutes and 20 seconds during a 6–0 against Wrexham. The club sold the stadium in December 2005 in a sale-and-leaseback deal with London property company Structadene.\r\n\r\nIn the 2010–11 a temporary south stand was built, but was removed during the 2011–12 season after attendances fell. In July 2011 the stadium was renamed the Seward Stadium after the naming rights were sold to the Seward Motor Group. Following Seward entering administration in February 2012, the ground was subsequently renamed the Goldsands Stadium in a two-year deal. During the summer of 2013 a 2,400 seat stand was built on the undeveloped end of the ground as a result of the club's promotion to the Championship. In July 2013 it was named after former club striker Ted MacDougall.","strStadiumLocation":"Bournemouth","intStadiumCapacity":"11464","strWebsite":"www.afcb.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/afcbournemouth\/","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/afcbournemouth","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/officialafcb","strDescriptionEN":"A.F.C.

The club plays at Dean Court in Kings Park, Boscombe, Bournemouth, Dorset and have been in existence since 1899.\r\n\r\nNicknamed The Cherries, the team traditionally played in red shirts with white sleeves until 1971, when the strip was changed to red and black stripes, similar to that of A.C. Milan. A predominantly red shirt was chosen for the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons before announcing a return to the stripes for the 2006–07 season due to fan demand.\r\n\r\nAfter narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League in the 2008–09 season, Bournemouth were promoted to League One at the end of the 2009–10. After making the League One play-off semi-finals in 2010–11 and achieving a mid-table finish in 2011–12, Bournemouth won promotion to the Championship at the end of the 2012–13 season, putting them in the second tier of the league for only the second time in their history.\r\n\r\nAlthough the exact date of the club's foundation is not known, there is proof that it was formed in the autumn of 1899 out of the remains of the older Boscombe St. John's Lads’ Institute F.C. The club was originally known as Boscombe F.C.. The first President was Mr. J.C. Nutt.\r\n\r\nIn their first season 1889–90 Boscombe F.C. competed in the Bournemouth and District Junior League. They also played in the Hants Junior Cup. During the first two seasons they played on a football pitch in Castlemain Avenue, Pokesdown. From their third season the team played on a pitch in King's Park. In the season of 1905–06 Boscombe F.C. graduated to senior amateur football.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the club was granted a long lease upon some wasteland next to Kings Park, as the clubs football ground, by their president Mr. J.E. Cooper-Dean. With their own ground, named Dean Court after the benefactor, the club continued to thrive and dominated the local football scene. Also in 1910 the club signed their first professional football player B. Penton.\r\n\r\nAround about this time the club obtained their nickname 'The Cherries'. Foremost there are two tales on how the club gained this pet name. First, because of the cherry-red striped shirts that the team played in and, perhaps more plausible, because Dean Court was built adjacent to the Cooper-Dean estate, which encompassed numerous cherry orchards.\r\n\r\nFor the first time during the season of 1913–14 the club competed in the F.A. Cup. The clubs progress was halted in 1914 with the outbreak of the war and Boscombe F.C. returned to the Hampshire league.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the Third Division was formed and Boscombe were promoted to the Southern League, with moderate success.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/y08nak1534071116.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/aaonqz1510842509.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/yttutv1448813203.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wvuypx1469485789.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/sxrxwp1469485821.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/uqqwvw1469485695.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/uwryss1469485747.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/sxypup1469486566.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/officiacherries","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"135966","idSoccerXML":"1366","idAPIfootball":"4701","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Brackley Town","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1890","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English National League North","idLeague":"4681","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"St. James Park","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"Brackley, England","intStadiumCapacity":"3500","strWebsite":"www.brackleytownfc.com","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Brackley Town Football Club is a football club based in Brackley, Northamptonshire, England.

City stayed up, with a then record low of 36 points, in the first season in the Premier League. Relegation followed the following season. Since then a series of financial crises did push the club to the brink of closure. The financial pressure resulted in two more relegations to League Two. In the 2012–13 season, they became the first ever team from the fourth tier of English football to reach a major domestic Wembley cup final, the Football League Cup, losing 5–0 to Swansea City.

It has been the home ground of Championship side Brentford since it was built in 1904. The ground is known for being the only English league football ground to have a pub on each corner and is situated in a predominantly residential area. The ground gets its name from the griffin, featured in the logo of Fuller's Brewery, which at one point owned the orchard on which the stadium was built.\r\n\r\nBetween forming in 1889 and prior to 1904, Brentford played at five grounds around Ealing - Clifden Road, Benns Field, Shotters Field, Cross Road and Boston Park Cricket Ground. In 1903, Fulham chairman Henry Norris (a prominent estate agent), Brentford manager Dick Molyneux and club president Edwin Underwood negotiated a 21 year lease at a peppercorn rent on an orchard along the Ealing Road (owned by local brewers Fuller, Smith and Turner), with the option to buy the freehold at a later date for £5000. After a gypsy camp was removed from the site, work began on building the ground in January 1904, under the guidance of architects Parr & Kates.\r\n\r\nThe ground was named 'Griffin Park' after a nearby pub, The Griffin, which was owned by the Griffin Brewery and was used as dressing rooms and for accommodation. After a number of trial games, Griffin Park was opened on 1 September 1904. The first match at the ground was played that day - a Western League fixture versus Plymouth Argyle, with 5,500 spectators watching the sides play out a draw. The first Football League match to be played at the ground was on the opening day of the 1920\/21 season, a 3-0 Third Division defeat to Exeter City.","strStadiumLocation":"Brentford, Hounslow, London","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"www.brentfordfc.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/brentfordfootballclub1889","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/brentfordfc","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/brentfordfc","strDescriptionEN":"Brentford Football Club are a professional football club based in Brentford, in the London Borough of Hounslow, that currently play in the Football League Championship. They were founded on 10 October 1889 and play their home games at Griffin Park, their home stadium since 1904, after a nomadic existence playing at five previous grounds. Brentford's most successful spell came during the 1930s, when they achieved consecutive top six finishes in the First Division. Since the Second World War, they have spent most of their time in the third and fourth tiers of English football. Brentford have been FA Cup quarter-finalists on four occasions, and have three times been Football League Trophy runners-up.\r\n\r\nFounded on 10 October 1889, at the Oxford and Cambridge Hotel public house in Brentford – next to Kew Bridge – a meeting was held, between the members of the Brentford Rowing Club, to decide between association football or rugby union, to serve as a winter pursuit for the rowing club and its members. As a result of a vote, by eight votes to five, taken six days later, association football was successful as the sport to partake in.\r\n\r\nThe football club started out playing its home matches at the Clifden House Ground – this was recreational land between what is now Clifden Road and Lateward Road – in Brentford, from November 1889 to March 1892. The very first fixture, between Brentford FC and Kew FC, was on 23 November 1889. Due to ownership of the land changing hands, Brentford FC were on the lookout for a new ground after only 30 months. In October 1892, Benn's Field – land behind The Plough PH Little Ealing Lane – in Little Ealing, was the club's new home. The football club decided to move nearer to Brentford and in December 1894 they moved to Shotter's Field – what is now Gunnersbury School, The Ride – and stayed there until April 1898. Due to high rent increases, the club were once again forced to move on, so in September 1898 the club moved to the Cross Roads Ground, in Little Ealing – land on the north west side of the junction of Little Ealing Lane and Ealing Road – this was used until April 1900. As the club grew, therefore entertaining larger crowds, a move to a ground with the chance of improving better spectator facilities, with under cover enclosures and changing rooms, was looked for. Boston Park Cricket Ground, in York Road, Brentford – what is now land along the east side of Ealing Road and south of the Great West Road – was then used from September 1900 to April 1904. Finally, in January 1904, the club agreed a 21-year lease on an orchard, once owned by Chiswick brewers Fuller, Smith and Turner. The clearance of the orchard, over 200 trees, and the levelling of the land took several months. Griffin Park, as it became known – supposedly named after the local The Griffin pub once used as a changing rooms in the early years – was now ready for use as a football ground after banking was raised along three sides of the ground and an enclosure, moved from their previous ground, was erected. In August 1904 trial matches were played on the pitch. Then the first competitive match was played, a reserve team game in the Western League v Plymouth Argyle. On 7 September 1904, Brentford and West Ham United played out a 0–0 draw, in the Southern League First Division, which was the first first team match.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, it was a founder member of the Third Division South. During the late 1920s and 1930s, the club began to make real progress. In the 1929–30 season, the side won all 21 of its home matches in the Third Division South, but still missed out on promotion. They are the last of six teams in English football to amass a perfect home record, and the only one to do so over a season of 42 matches or more. After several more near-misses, promotion to the Second Division was finally achieved in 1932–33. Two years later, Brentford reached the First Division and finished 5th in its debut season – which is still the club's highest ever league position – to complete a remarkable rise for the club. Under manager Harry Curtis and captain Arthur Bateman, Brentford achieved more impressive placings in the league for the rest of the decade (6th in the following two seasons) before the Second World War interrupted.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/grv1aw1546453779.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-134355-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/7tb0ib1509012429.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/6il97g1528109964.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/aw60n81528110040.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/senexf1528110051.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/5seb5c1528110103.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/wrdpae1528110167.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/brentfordfc","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133619","idSoccerXML":"24","idAPIfootball":"51","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Brighton","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Brighton and Hove Albion","intFormedYear":"1901","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English Premier League","idLeague":"4328","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Falmer Stadium","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/wqvxrw1420720245.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Falmer Stadium, known for sponsorship purposes as the American Express Community Stadium, or simply The Amex, is a football stadium near the village of Falmer in Brighton and Hove and is the home of Brighton & Hove Albion F.C..

They were relegated from the top division in the same season. Mismanagement brought Brighton close to relegation from the Football League to the Conference which they narrowly avoided in 1997 and 1998.

Gloucester Rugby played Bath in September and Exeter in October 2015 in pre-season friendlies whilst their home ground, Kingholm, was being used for the Rugby World Cup being held in England.","strStadiumLocation":"Horfield, Bristol","intStadiumCapacity":"12916","strWebsite":"www.bristolrovers.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/pages\/Bristol-Rovers\/114130001994558","strTwitter":"www.twitter.com\/Official_BRFC","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Bristol Rovers Football Club is an English professional association football club, based in Bristol, that competes in League Two, the fourth tier of English football.

It is the home ground of Premier League side Burnley Football Club, who have played there since moving from its Calder Vale ground in 1883. The stadium, which is situated on Harry Potts Way, named so after the club's longest serving Manager, has a capacity of 21,401, all seated. It was one of the last remaining stadiums in England to have the players' tunnel and dressing rooms behind one of the goals, until it was covered for seating in time for the 2014-15 Premier League season and rebuilt between the David Fishwick and James Hargreaves stand. The ground originally consisted of just a pitch and the first grandstand was not built until 1885. Six years after this, the \"Star\" stand was erected and terracing was later added to the ends of the ground. After the Second World War, the stadium was redeveloped with all four stands being rebuilt. During the 1990s, the ground underwent further refurbishment when the Longside and Bee Hole End terraces were replaced by all-seater stands. Currently, the four stands at Turf Moor are the James Hargreaves Stand, the Jimmy McIlroy Stand, the Bob Lord Stand and the Cricket Field Stand.\r\n\r\nBurnley played their first match at the ground on 17 February 1883, losing 3–6 to local side Rawtenstall. When Prince Albert Victor opened a new hospital in Burnley in 1886, Turf Moor became the first football ground to be visited by a member of the British Royal Family. The first Football League match at the ground took place on 6 October 1888, with Fred Poland scoring the first competitive goal at the stadium. The record attendance at Turf Moor was set in 1924 when 54,755 people attended an FA Cup tie between Burnley and Huddersfield Town. In the same year, Turf Moor hosted its only FA Cup semi-final to date. In 1927, the stadium was the venue of an international match between England and Wales. Since then, the ground has been used to host matches in the European Under-19 Championship and European Under-21 Championship fixtures.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, plans for expansion of Turf Moor were released to the public. The Burnley directors proposed a major development of the stadium, costing £20 million. The plans, which would incorporate the rebuilding of the Cricket Field Stand and the moving of the players' entrance tunnel, have been put on hold until the current financial climate improves. In 2009, following Burnley's promotion to the Premier League, the development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was announced. Director Paul Fletcher stated that the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor would eventually be 28,000 to cope with extra fans. However following the club's relegation from the Premier League in 2010, these plans were put on hold indefinitely.\r\n\r\nAfter again achieving promotion to the Premier League in 2014 further Ground renovations were undertaken to comply with new regulations include housing for International Media, relocation of the players tunnel and upgrades to seating in the David Fishwick Stand for away supporters. On 26 June 2014 the club unveiled a planning application for extensions to the Turf Moor front entrance including the rebuilding of the official Club Shop containing a first floor museum.","strStadiumLocation":"Harry Potts Way, Burnley, Lancashire","intStadiumCapacity":"21401","strWebsite":"www.burnleyfootballclub.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/officialburnleyfc","strTwitter":"www.twitter.com\/burnleyofficial","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/burnleyofficial","strDescriptionEN":"Burnley Football Club \/ˈbɜrnli\/ are a professional football club based in Burnley, Lancashire, who play in the Premier League, the highest level of English football.

The ground was built on the former site of the Pirelli UK Tyres Ltd Sports & Social Club, and having had the land donated to the club by Pirelli, in return for naming rights, the ground cost £7.2 million to build.\r\n\r\nThe ground was designed by architects Hadfield, Cawkwell and Davidson, and has served as the inspiration for numerous newer grounds, including Morecambe's Globe Arena, and the proposed Hayes & Yeading stadium.

The club participates in Football League Two, the fourth tier in the English football league system. The club's home ground is the Pirelli Stadium, having moved from Eton Park in 2005.\r\n\r\nThe club's nickname is The Brewers, stemming from the town's brewing heritage dating back hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nThe club competed in the non-League of English football from their founding in 1950 until 2009, despite the Football League heritage of their predecessors Burton Swifts, Burton United, and Burton Wanderers.\r\n\r\nThe town of Burton has had a chequered history of football clubs, partly due to the area's main sport traditionally in the past being rugby union. Many former Burton teams have struggled financially. Albion can claim lineage from Burton Swifts, Burton Town, Burton United and Burton Wanderers, all defunct football clubs in the town. Burton Albion were formed in 1950, and joined the Birmingham & District League\r\n\r\nAlbion began life at the Lloyds Foundry ground on Wellington Street, but high attendances meant that the club quickly searched for a more suitable home. Eton Park was built off Derby Road and officially opened on 20 September 1958, coinciding with the club's promotion to the Southern League. From then until its demolition in 2005, the Brewers played all their home games at Eton Park.\r\n\r\nThey have also had spells in the Northern Premier League (NPL), because of their location in the central Midlands. They entered the Conference in 2002 upon winning the NPL title.\r\n\r\nEton Park was dismantled to make way for housing, as the club had just completed a new stadium, at a cost of £7.2 million. It is directly opposite Eton Park and was named the Pirelli Stadium, situated as it was a short distance from Pirelli's factory in Burton. The stadium's capacity was originally set at 6,200, but then later raised to 6,912. The first match played there was a friendly between Burton Albion and Chester City on Saturday 16 July 2005.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbion in action against Gillingham in the final match of the 2012–13 season\r\nOne notable result at the ground was a 0–0 draw in the FA Cup third round against Manchester United on 8 January 2006. The result of the Third Round replay, lucratively played at Old Trafford, was a 5–0 win for Manchester United in front of over 11,000 Brewers fans. This constituted a record number of away fans seen at Old Trafford. On 8 January 2011, in the FA Cup third round, Burton continued their FA success, knocking out Championship team Middlesbrough 2–1. Shaun Harrad scored twice at the Pirelli Stadium in the last 8 minutes to bring Burton back from 1–0 down.\r\n\r\nAfter their FA Cup draw against Manchester United, Burton competed in the upper reaches of the Conference. The Brewers attained their highest ever league position to date in 2007–08, finishing in the end of season play-off places for the first time in their history, before losing in their play-off to Cambridge United. As of April 2009, they were top of the Conference National, setting a league record for the most consecutive wins. This is despite losing the services of manager Nigel Clough to Derby County with Roy McFarland installed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. When the team was 19 points clear at the top of the table, Conference sponsors Blue Square declared Burton the winners of the 2008\/09 title in a PR stunt in which they paid out all bets. After that announcement in February, however, the club saw their lead reduced week by week, though they still secured promotion to the Football League, despite losing 2–1 away at Torquay United in the final game of the season when Cambridge United could only manage a goalless draw to Altrincham.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the season, it was decided that Roy McFarland would not stay permanently as the Burton manager. After a lengthy search, the club announced that Paul Peschisolido would become the club's new manager with Gary Rowett his assistant. Burton's first win in the Football League was a 5–2 win over Morecambe at the Pirelli Stadium.\r\n\r\nThe Brewers finished a respectable 13th in their first campaign in the Football League, and 19th in their second campaign after a season much interrupted by the weather. Following an end of season collapse, Burton fell from 5th place on Boxing Day to 17th place at the end of the 2011–12 season, which included a 17 game winless run and the sacking of Paul Peschisolido. In Gary Rowett's first full season in charge, he led them to 4th and the play-offs, missing out on automatic promotion by two points. Following the fourth place finish, Burton lost their play-off semi-final 4–5 on aggregate to Bradford City despite winning the first leg 3–2 at Valley Parade. After this season the Brewers came back and, despite finishing 6th in the 2013–14 season, they reached the play-off final but lost a narrow match 1–0 against Fleetwood Town. During the 2014–15 season Rowett left to join Birmingham City, and was replaced by Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/uvpqpw1423804499.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/ttptvv1454115364.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/bjpqv21509012529.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/vs0he91538511888.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/r8xqaa1538511906.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/6sk0ef1538511928.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/e5dtxu1538511941.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/ukocdj1535704375.jpg","strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134359","idSoccerXML":"815","idAPIfootball":"1344","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Bury","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1885","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"_Defunct Soccer Teams","idLeague":"4519","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Gigg Lane Stadium","strKeywords":"The Shakers, BFC","strRSS":"http:\/\/www.buryfc.co.uk\/common\/rss\/news-rss-feed.xml","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/mfl2jj1506591308.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Gigg Lane is an all-seater football stadium in Bury, Greater Manchester, England.

The stadium is located in the Abbey area of the city on Newmarket Road, approximately 3 kilometres (1.8miles) east of the city centre. The closest railway station is Cambridge North, which is located about 20 minutes' walk away. Due to sponsorship reasons, between 2009 and 2016 the ground was also known as The R. Costings Abbey Stadium and is currently officially named the Cambs Glass Stadium. The stadium currently has a capacity of 8,127, of which 4,376 are seated.\r\n\r\nBefore opening the Abbey with a victory over Cambridge University Press in a friendly on 31 August 1932, United had played matches at a number of venues around the city. When playing under the Abbey United name, games were played on Midsummer Common until the outbreak of World War I. When the war ended, the club moved to Stourbridge Common and, after promotion to the Cambridgeshire League Division One in 1923, moved once again to land just off Newmarket Road in Cambridge. This ground, affectionately known as the 'Celery Trenches' due to the poor state of the pitch, was christened with a 1–0 league victory over Histon Institute and became United's home for a decade. While based at the Trenches, the club established its offices at the 'Dog & Pheasant' pub on Newmarket Road, which it used as an away dressing room on matchdays, as well as a store for equipment including the pitch's goalposts. However, the Cambridgeshire FA were unhappy with the state of the pitch at this new home, and the club moved to Parker's Piece at the start of the 1930–31 season. Despite the special significance of Parker's Piece in the history of football, it being the first place where the Cambridge Rules were played out, the lack of spectator capacity and disruption caused during games meant this move was not a successful one.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbey Stadium viewed from the South Stand\r\nIn January 2006, John Howard announced plans to move out of the Abbey Stadium to a new purpose built stadium in Milton. This was supported by Cambridgeshire Horizons. These were criticised by fans as risking the club's identity by moving out of the city and, despite Howard describing them as crucial to the club's future, little else was heard of them publicly. Subsequently, a new community stadium, that would also include conference facilities, was ruled out by a Planning Inspector's report which described it as unsuitable development in the green belt and in October 2009, Cambridge United announced its intentions to redevelop the Abbey Stadium with chairman.\r\n\r\nThe Stadium was sold by Bideawhile to Grosvenor Estates in June 2010. Soon after, the new landlords, in combination with the club and supporters group Cambridge Fans United, announced that they had signed a Memorandum of Understanding to positively work together to achieve the relocation of the club to a new stadium. In January 2011, plans for a new community stadium were unveiled at an open meeting, including potential new locations both within the city and outside it.\r\n\r\nIn September 2011, Grosvenor Estates announced that they, in partnership with property firm Wrenbridge had managed to cut down the potential sites to just two, both on greenbelt land. This was later cut to one, Trumpington Meadows, to the South West of the city. They revealed they plan for the new community stadium to be an 8,000 seated and terraced stadium to be built within a new Cambridge Sporting Village incorporating housing and retail development with the stadium as the focal point. However, objections from residents and local councils saw the proposal blocked in 2013. Plans announced in January 2015 keep the sporting village development at Trumpington, but without the new stadium. Instead Cambridge United will redevelop the Abbey Stadium.\r\n\r\nIn May 2015, Grosvenor had released their first sketches of potential designs for the redeveloped stadium, with plans to change the name to the Cambridge Community Stadium. At present, the main plans are to increase the capacity in the Newmarket Road End to 3,500 and to introduce safe standing. The new design will also include community facilities for public use. The Habbin Terrace will also be completely redeveloped, which will see it become fully seated and expanded as well. The main stand will also be expanded slightly and redeveloped.","strStadiumLocation":"Cambridge, England","intStadiumCapacity":"8127","strWebsite":"www.cambridge-united.co.uk","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/cambridgeutdfc","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Cambridge United Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city of Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England.

The stadium has a capacity of 8,127, made up of terracing and seated areas.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1912 as Abbey United, and took the name Cambridge United in 1951. They played in local amateur leagues before joining the Southern League after finishing as runners-up of the Eastern Counties League in 1957–58. Under Bill Leivers's stewardship they were crowned Southern League Premier Division champions in 1968–69 and 1969–70, which helped to secure their election into the Football League in 1970. They won promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1972–73, but suffered immediate relegation. They won the Fourth Division title in 1976–77, and then secured promotion out of the Third Division the following season. They remained in the Second Division for six seasons, before they suffered consecutive relegations.\r\n\r\nManager John Beck led United to promotion out of the Fourth Division via play-offs in 1990 and then the Third Division title in 1990–91, with the club reaching the Second Division play-offs the following season. Two relegations in three years left Cambridge back in the fourth tier, before promotion was secured at the end of the 1998–99 campaign. They entered the Conference in 2005 after two relegations in four seasons, where they remained for nine seasons. They finished as runners-up of the Conference three times, but were beaten in the play-off finals in 2008 and 2009, before eventually securing promotion after winning the 2014 play-off final.\r\n\r\nAlthough the club has traditionally worn amber and black at home, it has experimented with a number of designs of shirts including plain amber with black trim, amber and black squares, stripes and, amber with a black sash. The club had close links with Cambridge Regional College, a team that operated as a de facto reserve team between 2006 and 2014.

The ground dates from 1919, at a time when Charlton were moderately successful and looking for a new home. The club found an abandoned sand and chalk pit in Charlton, but did not have sufficient funds to fully develop the site. An army of volunteer Charlton supporters dug out a massive pit for the pitch, and used the soil from the excavation to build up the sides. The ground's name most likely comes from its original valley-like appearance. The club played its first game at the ground before any seats, or even terraces, were installed; there was simply a roped-off pitch with the crowd standing or sitting on the adjoining earthworks. The unique circumstances of the ground's initial construction led to an unusually intense bond between the club's supporters and the site that exists to this day. In the 1923–24 season, Charlton played at the Mount stadium in Catford but in a much higher populated area. A proposed merger with Catford South End FC fell through and thus Charlton moved back to the Valley.\r\n\r\nIn 1967, Len Silver the promoter at Hackney made an application to open Charlton as a British League speedway club, and plans were put forward to construct a track around the perimeter of the football pitch. The application to include speedway at the Valley was enthusiastically supported initially, but was eventually ruled out on the grounds of noise nuisance.","strStadiumLocation":"Floyd Road, Charlton, London","intStadiumCapacity":"27111","strWebsite":"www.cafc.co.uk\/page\/Welcome","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Charlton Athletic Football Club is an English football club based in Charlton in the Royal Borough of Greenwich, London.

During the early parts of World War II the ground was shared by Southend United, before it became a barrage balloon site in 1942. On two occasions (the 1930s and 1940s) the stadium hosted greyhound racing. The record attendance of 16,807 was set for a local derby with Colchester United on 10 September 1949. Floodlights were installed in 1960 and several plans were made to increase facilities at the ground, including installing a swimming pool and building office blocks or a hotel, but none came to fruition. The club's first floodlit game was against Wisbech Town on 21 September 1960, with the official opening coming in a friendly against Norwich City on 3 October 1960.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, the site was sold to developers and the club had to move out of Chelmsford. They initially shared at Maldon Town's Wallace Binder Ground, before moving to Billericay Town's New Lodge. In January 2006, the club moved back to Chelmsford when they became a tenants at the Melbourne Stadium, also known as Chelmsford Sport and Athletics Centre. The centre first had a track in 1934, before a cinder track was opened in 1962 alongside with two seated stands on one side of the track, together holding 700 spectators. It hosted Chelmsford City Ladies matches, as the pitch inside the track was too small for men's football. The Ladies team left the ground when the stands were dismantled, although a new 270-seat stand was built in the early 2000s.\r\n\r\nChelmsford City announced that they would be moving to the Melbourne Stadium in March 2004. Following the announcement another stand was built on the other side of the pitch. The first game back at Melbourne Park was against former landlords Billericay Town on 2 January 2006 and was played in front of a then-record crowd of 2,998. The club has plans to upgrade the stadium to a 5,000 capacity capable of achieving the necessary 'A' ground grading.

The team competes in the National League, the fifth tier of the English football league system. Chesterfield play their home games at the 10,504 capacity Proact Stadium, having moved from their historic home of Saltergate during the summer of 2010. Notable players include record appearance holder Dave Blakey, who played in 617 of Chesterfield's league games, and 162 league goal club record holder Ernie Moss. The club contests numerous minor local rivalries, though Nottinghamshire club Mansfield Town are considered to be their main rivals.\r\n\r\nChesterfield F.C. was officially established in 1866, though it would be the third incarnation of that name that turned professional in 1891 and changed its name to Chesterfield Town. Town entered the FA Cup for the first time the following year, and competed in the Sheffield & District League and Sheffield & Hallamshire Senior Cup, before joining the Midland League in 1896–97. A third-place finish in 1898–99 resulted in a successful application to the Football League Second Division for the following season. After ten seasons in the Second Division they failed to gain re-election to the League and returned to the Midland League in 1909, finishing as champions in 1909–10. The club entered liquidation in 1915, and were reformed as Chesterfield Municipal in April 1919. They again rejoined the Midland League and finished as champions in 1919–20.\r\n\r\nThe club was renamed to Chesterfield F.C. in December 1920, and became founder members of the Third Division North in 1921–22. They marked their tenth season in the division, 1930–31, by winning the title, though only managed two seasons in the Second Division before suffering relegation. They again won the Third Division North title in 1935–36, and after World War II recorded their best ever league finish of fourth in the Second Division in 1946–47. However they were relegated again in 1950–51, and were relegated out of the Third Division in 1960–61. Chesterfield won the Fourth Division in 1969–70, and then won the Anglo-Scottish Cup in 1980. After relegation in 1982–83, they again won the Fourth Division title in 1984–85, though would again be relegated after five seasons in the third tier. They secured their return to the third tier with a 2–0 win over Bury in the 1995 play-off Final at Wembley.\r\n\r\nChesterfield reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1997, but were relegated back to the basement division in 1999–2000. They made an immediate return to the third tier after securing a Third Division automatic promotion place in 2000–01. Relegated in 2006–07, they secured the League Two title in 2010–11, but were relegated from League One the following season. In 2011, Dave Allen took full ownership of the club and oversaw progress to two League Trophy finals; Chesterfield won the trophy with a 2–0 victory over Swindon Town in 2012, and finished as runners-up after losing 3–1 to Peterborough United in 2014. Chesterfield were crowned champions of League Two for a record fourth time in 2013–14, but remained in League One for just three seasons. Two consecutive relegations saw the club relegated out of the English Football League at the end of the 2017–18 season.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/vwwpry1424032525.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/rrprqw1454115379.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"136256","idSoccerXML":"4917","idAPIfootball":"8147","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Chippenham Town FC","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1873","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English National League South","idLeague":"4682","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Hardenhuish Park","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"The club moved to Hardenhuish Park in 1919, having previously played at at least four other grounds.

It has been the home ground of Birmingham City Football Club for more than a century.\r\n\r\nConstructed and opened in 1906 to replace the Muntz Street ground, which had become too small to meet the club's needs, the original St Andrew's could hold an estimated 75,000 spectators, housed in one grandstand and a large uncovered terrace. The attendance record, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341, was set at a 1939 FA Cup tie against Everton. During the Second World War, St Andrew's suffered bomb damage and the grandstand, housing a temporary fire station, burned down in an accidental fire. In the 1950s, the club replaced the stand and installed floodlights, and later erected a second small stand and roofed over the open terraces, but there were few further changes.\r\n\r\nThe ground became dilapidated: a boy was killed when a wall collapsed during rioting in the 1980s. When new owners took the club out of administration in 1993, they began a six-year redevelopment programme during which the ground was converted to an all-seater stadium to comply with the Taylor Report into safety at sports grounds, and all areas apart from the Main Stand were completely rebuilt. The seating capacity of the modern stadium is just over 30,000. It has function rooms suitable for business or social events and a club store selling Birmingham City merchandise. A 2004 proposal that the club should sell the ground and move into a multi-purpose City of Birmingham Stadium remains speculative. In 2013, the ground was listed as an Asset of Community Value under the Localism Act 2011.\r\n\r\nSt Andrew's has been the venue for England international football matches at all levels below the senior national team, and for semifinal matches in the FA Cup and finals of lesser competitions. It has played host to events in other sports, including rugby union and professional boxing, and more recently has staged music concerts.\r\nThe arena was opened officially by Dame Kelly Holmes and sports minister Richard Caborn on 24 February 2007. By this time the arena had been open for a year and had already hosted a sell-out England U21 football match against Germany as well as a full season of Coventry City football matches.\r\n\r\nThe Ricoh Arena was the first cashless stadium in the United Kingdom, with customers using a prepay smartcard system in the grounds bars and shops. However, the stadium now accepts cash at all kiosks.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was initially operated by Arena Coventry Limited (ACL), with Coventry City F.C. as tenants. ACL was owned jointly by Coventry City Council and the Higgs Charity until both shareholders were bought out by rugby union Premiership club Wasps in October and November 2014. Wasps' first home match in Coventry was on 21 December 2014 against London Irish.","strStadiumLocation":"Birmingham","intStadiumCapacity":"32609","strWebsite":"www.ccfc.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/CoventryCityFC","strTwitter":"www.twitter.com\/Coventry_City","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Coventry City F.C. is an English association football club based in Coventry in the West Midlands. The team competes in League One, the third tier of the English football league system. Nicknamed the Sky Blues owing to the colour of their strip, Coventry City were formed in 1883 as Singers F.C., and they joined the Football League in 1919. Their only major trophy was won in 1987 when they beat Tottenham Hotspur 3–2 to win the FA Cup in a match listed by the FA as one of the twelve classic FA Cup Finals, and they are one of only five clubs to have ever won the FA Cup and FA Youth Cup 'double' in the same season. They also reached two Football League Cup semi-finals, in 1981 and 1990.\r\n\r\nThe club was an inaugural member of the Premier League in 1992 and had spent an impressive 34 consecutive seasons (since 1967) in the English top flight prior to their relegation in 2001. Following eleven seasons in the second-tier Football League Championship without any significant success, Coventry were relegated to Football League One in 2012, the first time in 48 years that the club played in the English league system's third tier.\r\n\r\nCoventry has only qualified for European competition once, during the 1970–71 season, when they competed in the European Fairs Cup (now the UEFA Europa League), reaching the second round. Despite beating Bayern Munich 2–1 in their home leg, they had lost 1–6 in the first leg in Munich to go out of the competition. They were unable to compete in the 1987–88 UEFA Cup Winner's Cup due to the ban on English clubs at that time.\r\n\r\nFrom 1899 to 2005, Coventry City played at the Highfield Road stadium. In 1981 it became the first all-seater stadium in English football, though by the late-1990s the club's directors decided it was time to construct a larger stadium and chose a site in the Rowley's Green area of the city. The 32,609-capacity Ricoh Arena was opened in August 2005, but following a rent dispute with the ground's owners the club opted to play their home games at Northampton Town's Sixfields Stadium starting in the 2013–14 season. A return to the Ricoh Arena was announced on 21 August 2014 by the club after a one-year absence.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/uxyqys1424033798.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133625-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/0zyly31536678287.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/ay2hf91534861338.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/w3ylmq1534861316.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/9tcz911534861367.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/eqts3i1534861408.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/jp26d71536863295.jpg","strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134363","idSoccerXML":"819","idAPIfootball":"1362","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Crawley","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Crawley Town, Crawley Town FC","intFormedYear":"1896","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English League 2","idLeague":"4397","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Broadfield Stadium","strKeywords":"The Reds, Red Devils","strRSS":"http:\/\/www.crawleytownfc.com\/common\/rss\/news-rss-feed.xml","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/ie8yje1533675205.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Broadfield Stadium (known as the Checkatrade.com Stadium for sponsorship purposes) is a multi-purpose stadium in Crawley, England.

It is the current home ground of Crystal Palace Football Club playing in the Premier League.\r\n\r\nIn 1922 the site, a former brickfield, was bought from the Brighton Railway Company for £2,570. The stadium (designed by Scottish stadium architect Archibald Leitch) was constructed by Humphreys of Kensington (a firm regularly used by Leitch) for around £30,000, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of London on 30 August 1924. There was then only one stand (the present Main Stand), but this was unfinished due to industrial action; Crystal Palace played Sheffield Wednesday and lost 0–1 in front of 25,000 fans.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1926, England played Wales in an international at the stadium. England amateur matches and various other finals were also staged there, as were other sports including boxing, bicycle polo (in the late 1940s) and cricket and music concerts (in the 1980s). In addition to this, it hosted two games for the 1948 Summer Olympics.\r\n\r\nIn 1953, the stadium's first floodlights were installed consisting of numerous poles around the 3 sides of terracing and four roof mounted installations on the Main Stand, but were replaced nine years later by floodlights mounted on, pylons in each corner and six installations on the Main Stand roof. Real Madrid marked the occasion by playing the first game under the new set of bulbs – a real footballing coup at the time for third division Palace, as it was Real's first ever match in London.","strStadiumLocation":"South Norwood, London","intStadiumCapacity":"26255","strWebsite":"www.cpfc.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/officialcpfc","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/cpfc","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/CPFC","strDescriptionEN":"Crystal Palace Football Club is an English professional football club based in South Norwood, London. They currently play in the highest level in English football, the Premier League. Since 1964, the club have mostly played in the top two leagues of English football. The club was founded in 1905 at the site of the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building by the owners of the FA Cup Final stadium, who wanted their own team to play at the historic venue. Palace applied to be elected to The Football League, but this was rejected and they instead joined the Southern Football League Second Division, playing home games at The Crystal Palace, inspiration for the club's initial nickname, \"The Glaziers\". Palace won the Division and promotion in their first season, and played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the Southern League Division One formed the Football League Third Division. Palace won the division and gained promotion to the Second Division, where they spent four seasons before suffering relegation to the Third Division South. In 1958 a league re-organisation saw Palace become founder members of Division Four. Over the next eleven years the club moved from the lowest rung of English Football to the highest, reaching the First Division in 1969, and staying in the top division for four seasons before suffering successive relegations. In 1973 the club modernised its image, changing the nickname from The Glaziers to \"The Eagles\" and ending the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. The club stabilised itself in the top two divisions with promotions in 1977 and 1979, the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two Champions. The period between 1989–91 was a successful time for the club. They reached an FA Cup Final in 1990, won the Full Members Cup in 1991, and achieved third place in the top division in the 1990–1991 season. Palace became founder members of the Premier League in 1992, but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club then achieved promotion back to the Premier League three times in 1994, 1997 and 2004, but each time suffered relegation at the end of the following season. Palace entered administration in both 2000 and 2010, and are now owned by a consortium of four. The club were promoted back to the Premier League with a 1–0 win over Watford in the Football League play-offs in May 2013.\r\n\r\nCrystal Palace initially played their games in the grounds of The Crystal Palace, but the First World War saw them forced to move out, and they enjoyed a number of seasons at both the Herne Hill Velodrome and The Nest. Since 1924, Palace have played their home games at Selhurst Park. Their home colours are red and blue vertical stripes, though prior to 1973 they wore claret and pale blue after the fashion of Aston Villa. They have a fierce rivalry with M23 neighbours Brighton & Hove Albion, with whom they have contested the M23 derby 98 times and also enjoy a strong rivalry with fellow South London team Millwall. The club's kit is currently made by Macron, and the shirt sponsor is Neteller. The club captain is Mile Jedinak and the current player of the year is Julian Speroni. Edmund Goodman is the club's longest serving manager, and Jim Cannon has made the most appearances for the club. Peter Simpson is the club's top scorer for both one season and overall, netting 54 and 165 respectively. The highest transfer fee received has been for Wilfried Zaha from Manchester United in January 2013.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/rytxyw1448813222.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133632-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/woip371509012248.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/svsvqv1424367005.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/3trd0z1547482101.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/yvuwup1424367035.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/ryuspy1424367053.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/vpvqyu1424562192.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCWB9N0012fG6bGyj486Qxmg","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"136001","idSoccerXML":"4767","idAPIfootball":"4703","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Curzon","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Curzon Ashton F.C.","intFormedYear":"1963","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English National League North","idLeague":"4681","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Tameside Stadium","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, England","intStadiumCapacity":"4000","strWebsite":"www.curzon-ashton.co.uk","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Curzon Ashton Football Club is a semi-professional football club based in the market town of Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the National League North, the sixth-highest division overall in the English football league system, and are members of the Manchester County Football Association.

It has a capacity of 6,078.\r\n\r\nThe site on Victoria Road has been a football ground since 1917, when it was used by the Sterling Works side, whose factory was situated alongside it. It was not fully enclosed until the summer of 1955, when Briggs Sports moved out to Rush Green Road, and Dagenham F.C. moved from the Arena. During that summer they levelled and re-seeded the pitch, removed the stones from the playing surface and extended the banking and the terracing. The only cover was a tiny wooden stand, which was steep and narrow and had a few rows of seating on the far side of the ground. The main stand was built in the autumn of 1955 and was opened on 7 January 1956 by J.W. Bowers, chairman of the Essex County Football Association. During the summer of 1956 the turnstile block at the Victoria Road side of the ground and the men's toilets situated at the Victoria Road were added. In the summer of 1958 the cover over the far side was erected at a cost of £1,400. The first floodlitBrian Cox match at Victoria Road was Dagenham v Woodford in the FA Youth Cup on 26 September 1957 and the first senior match was a friendly against Rainham Town F.C. on 19 March 1958. The attendance record was set in 1967 with the visit of Reading F.C. in the FA Cup when 7200 crammed into the ground.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ground was regularly maintained, it changed little until the arrival of Redbridge Forest in 1990 to ground share. They paid for a new stand to be erected in the corner of the ground to increase the seating capacity and replaced the grass banking with concrete terracing. These improvements brought the ground up to the standard required by the Football Conference. Redbridge Forest and Dagenham merged in July 1992 and the ground improvements have continued right up to the present day. In 1995 they replaced the crumbling pitch perimeter wall with a new brick-built one and two years later rebuilt the toilet block at the Victoria Road end of the ground. The club brought in Bill O'Neil from Atcost to design and build a new purpose-built stand. The new 800-seater, which brings the seating capacity to over a thousand, was used for the first time for the Essex Senior Cup final against Canvey Island on 4 August 2001, twelve weeks after the old stand was last used. During summer 2001 new turnstile blocks were constructed and the eight floodlights were replaced with four corner ones.\r\n\r\nIn October 2001, Bass brewers agreed a £150,000 sponsorship of the new stand, now named the Carling Stand. This provided the funds for the improvements to continue and a number of crush barriers were installed in 2002, which helped ease the flow of spectators around the ground along with a new walkway behind the covered terrace. Whilst the Dagenham & Redbridge record attendance is 5,949, set against Ipswich Town in January 2002, these improvements have enabled the ground to meet Football League status and the capacity is now 6,078. In July 2007 a new sponsorship deal was set up with the Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council with the stadium renamed the London Borough of Barking & Dagenham Stadium.\r\n\r\nThe Traditional Builders & Contractors Ltd Stand at the west end of the ground (Pondfield Road end) was built during the close season of 2009; it has a capacity of 1,240 and is all seated. Access to the away stand is via gates at the far end of the ground from the entrance via Victoria Road. The stand has disabled facilities, and also incorporates a bar, snack bar, and new club office and changing facilities. The players now emerge onto the pitch from a tunnel in the stand (left) rather than the old tunnel in the middle of the Carling Stand.\r\n\r\nThe floodlights were replaced in the summer of 2012 bringing the Chigwell Construction Stadium fully up to the new Football League regulations with regards to floodlighting.","strStadiumLocation":"Dagenham, England","intStadiumCapacity":"6078","strWebsite":"www.daggers.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/OfficialDaggers","strTwitter":"www.twitter.com\/DAG_REDFC","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Dagenham & Redbridge Football Club, informally known as the Daggers, is an English association football club based in Dagenham, in the London Borough of Barking & Dagenham, East London.

It is the current home of Football League Championship club Derby County, who moved to the stadium from the Baseball Ground upon its opening in 1997. With space for 33,597 spectators, Pride Park Stadium has the sixteenth-largest capacity of any English football stadium, the twentieth-largest of any stadium in the United Kingdom, and the one hundred and twenty-first-largest in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe ground has hosted one full England international. Pride Park was renamed the iPro Stadium on 7 December 2013, as part of a 10-year, £7 million sponsorship deal with global sports' drink company iPro.\r\n\r\nBefore moving to the Pride Park Stadium, Derby County were based at The Baseball Ground since 1895. Although at its peak the ground had held over 40,000 (the record attendance being 41,826 for a match against Tottenham Hotspur in 1969) the Taylor Report, actioned after the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster had seen the legal requirement for English football stadia to become all-seater by 1994–95 season  resulting in its capacity dwindling to just 17,500 by the mid-1990s, not enough for the then-ambitious second tier club. An additional problem came with the ground's wooden components (considered unacceptable in the wake of the Bradford City stadium fire in 1985) and, in February 1996, chairman Lionel Pickering made the decision to move the club to a new stadium, having originally planned to rebuild the Baseball Ground as a 26,000-seat stadium.\r\n\r\nThe club originally planned to build a purpose-built 30,000-seat stadium at Pride Park, with 4,000 car parking spaces, restaurant and conference facilities, a fitness centre, a supporters club and new training ground. A year later the stadium plan was changed to become part of a £46 million project by the Stadivarios group that would also include a 10,000-seat indoor arena. However, Peter Gadsby, the club's associate director at the time and head of the Miller Birch construction company felt the project was both too ambitious and expensive and instead plans were drawn up by new Chairman Lionel Pickering to modernise and extend the Baseball Ground to hold 26,000, at a cost of £10 million. However, despite signing a construction agreement with Taylor Woodrow, Gadsby suggested the club make a second attempt at securing the then-redeveloping Pride Park business park, settling with Derby City Council for a smaller site than previously agreed. On 21 February 1996, prior to a match against Luton Town at The Baseball Ground, the club announced to supporters the decision to move to a £16 m state-of-the-art stadium for the start of the 1997–98 season.\r\n\r\nDerby City Council were paid £1.8 million for the land and the club's four directors – Lionel Pickering, Peter Gadsby, Stuart Webb and John Kirkland each paid £2.5m towards a package deal to pay for the stadium. The stadium itself was based upon Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium, which opened in 1995, though it had more than 30 amendments to the original plans. After toying with the idea of naming the new ground \"The New Baseball Ground\", it was settled that the club's new home would be called The Pride Park Stadium.","strStadiumLocation":"Pride Park, Derby","intStadiumCapacity":"33500","strWebsite":"www.dcfc.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/DerbyCountyOfficial","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/dcfcofficial","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/dcfcofficial","strDescriptionEN":"Derby County Football Club \/ˈdɑrbi ˈkaʊnti\/ is an English football club based in Derby.

Additionally, the club was a strong force in the interwar years and won the 1945–46 FA Cup.\r\n\r\nThe club adopted its now traditional black and white club colours in the 1890s and appropriated its club nickname The Rams, a tribute to its links with the First Regiment of Derby Militia, which took a ram as its mascot and the song \"The Derby Ram\" as its regimental song, at the same time. Home games are played at the iPro Stadium, located in Pride Park, Derby, where the club moved in 1997. As of 2014, the club plays in the Football League Championship and are managed by Steve McClaren.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/jioo4z1557155744.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133627-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/tptmwg1508249114.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/aligcd1537123873.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/0ak9zp1537123892.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/ddm7q91537123902.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/pq18xy1537123910.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/k21c851537370015.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/DCTV1884","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"135972","idSoccerXML":"1373","idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Didcot Town","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"0","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"_No League","idLeague":"4367","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Draycott Engineering Loop Meadow Stadium","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"www.didcottownfc.co.uk","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Didcot Town Football Club are a football club based in Didcot in Oxfordshire, England.

Three seasons later the team won the title again and this time gained promotion to the Conference, where they spent nine seasons before being relegated at the end of the 2001–02 season. The club was transferred from the Southern League to the Isthmian League in 2004, competing in that league's Premier Division for one season before mounting financial problems led the club to a further relegation. In the 2007–08 season, Dover won Division One South of the league, before winning the Premier Division in 2008–09 and thus gaining promotion to the Conference South.

The team's home ground has been Stonebridge Road since its inception in 1946.\r\n\r\nBefore 2007, the club was called Gravesend & Northfleet. Between 2008 and 2013, the club was owned by the web-based venture MyFootballClub, whose members voted on player transfers, budgets and ticket prices among other things instead of those decisions being made exclusively by the club's management and staff as at most other clubs.\r\n\r\nGravesend & Northfleet F.C. was formed in 1946, following the Second World War, after a merger between Gravesend United (originally formed in 1893) and Northfleet United (originally formed in 1890) with the new club retaining the red & white home colours (and the Stonebridge Road stadium) of Northfleet United. From 1969 and 1971, Roy Hodgson, who later became manager of the national teams of Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, Finland and England, was a player at the club, making 59 appearances. In 1979, the team was one of the founder members of the Alliance Premier League, but were relegated back into the Southern League Premier Division three seasons later.\r\n\r\nFor the 1997–98 season, Gravesend & Northfleet left the Southern League and joined the Isthmian League. They played in the Premier Division of the league until the 2001–02 season, when they finished as champions and earned promotion back into the Football Conference, where they remained until being relegated to the Conference South at the end of the 2009–10 season.\r\n\r\nOn 13 November 2007, it was announced that the website MyFootballClub had entered a deal in principle to take over the club. Approximately 27,000 MyFootballClub members each paid £35 to provide an approximate £700,000 takeover fund and all owned an equal share in the club but made no profit nor received a dividend. Members had a vote on transfers as well as player selection and all major decisions. Because of the nature of MyFootballClub, it was announced that manager Daish would become instead the first team head coach. His backroom staff would remain at the club.\r\n\r\nBetween 16 and 23 January 2008, MyFootballClub members were given the choice to vote on whether to proceed with the takeover and whether to allow Liam Daish to continue with his plans for the January transfer window. Both resulted in overwhelming \"Yes\" votes: 95.89% voted to proceed with the takeover while 95.86% voted to allow Daish to continue his transfer plans. The deal was ratified at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the club's board on 19 February.\r\n\r\nOn 10 May 2008, Ebbsfleet United won the FA Trophy, defeating Torquay United 1–0 in the final on the club's first trip to Wembley, becoming the first Kentish team to win this trophy. Ebbsfleet United went on to win the Kent Senior Cup in the same season, with a 4–0 victory over Cray Wanderers on 26 July 2008.\r\n\r\nAfter one year of ownership a majority of MyFC members failed to renew, with membership numbers dropping from a peak of 32,000 at the time of the takeover to just over 9,000 on deadline day 2009. The club had previously stated that 15,000 was the minimum required. As of September 2010, two and a half years after the takeover, there were around 3,500 members.\r\n\r\nIn an October 2010 vote among MyFC members, the earlier decision to allow the team manager autonomy in transfer dealings was rescinded by a majority of 35 on a total vote of 132, meaning that the membership would have 48 hours to endorse a proposed signing or sale before it can be finalised. Both the manager and the club secretary opposed the change.\r\n\r\nOn 15 May 2011, Ebbsfleet United won the Conference South play-off final 4–2 against Farnborough and were thus promoted back to the Conference Premier at the first time of asking,\r\n\r\nOn 23 December 2011, it was announced that the club needed to raise £50,000 by the end of the 2011–12 season or risk going out of business.\r\n\r\nOn 23 April 2013 it was announced that MyFC's members had voted in favour of handing two thirds of MyFC's shares to the Fleet Trust, a supporters' trust for the club, and the final one third to one of the club's major shareholders (believed to be former club chairman Phil Sonsara).","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/6jh8751512033141.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"136152","idSoccerXML":"4863","idAPIfootball":"1840","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Ebbsfleet United","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Ebbsfleet","intFormedYear":"1946","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English National League","idLeague":"4590","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Stonebridge Road","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/xqwxd11573138963.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Stonebridge Road is a multi-purpose stadium in Northfleet, Gravesend, Kent, England, also known as Kuflink Stadium for sponsorship reasons.

The stadium is built in a residential area served by regular rail and bus services two miles (3 km) from Liverpool city centre.\r\n\r\nGoodison has undergone many changes over the years and it presently has an all-seated capacity of 39,572. Everton fans refer to the stadium as \"The Grand Old Lady\" and the abridged \"Goodison\".\r\n\r\nIt has hosted more top-flight games than any other stadium in England. Goodison has hosted the maximum number of league games since the Premier League was formed in 1992, as Everton have remained in the top tier of English football since 1954. The club has only been outside the top division for four seasons, having only been relegated twice (in 1930 and 1951).\r\n\r\nAs well as hosting Everton games, the stadium has been the venue for an FA Cup Final and numerous international fixtures, including several in the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The record for the highest attendance in women's football was set at Goodison Park in 1920, which stood for 92 years until 31 July 2012. This game's high attendance resulted in women's football being banned by the Football Association for 50 years as they felt it threatened the men's game.\r\n\r\nGoodison Park was conceived in unusual circumstances: two factions of politicians on the Everton board grappled to control the destiny of the club. A split emerged with the members with the majority leaving their home at Anfield forming Goodison Park. Everton F.C.'s relocation to Goodison Park was one of the earliest cases of a team moving to a new stadium for monetary benefit.","strStadiumLocation":"Walton, Liverpool","intStadiumCapacity":"40157","strWebsite":"www.evertonfc.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/Everton","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/everton","strInstagram":"instagram.com\/officialeverton","strDescriptionEN":"Everton Football Club \/ˈɛvərtən\/ are an English professional football club based in Liverpool, and currently playing in the Premier League.

Originally known as the Gateshead Youth Stadium, the venue was built in 1955 at a cost of £30,000. It has since been extensively re-developed on three occasions. Its capacity of around 11,800 is the greatest in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, the third-largest in Tyne and Wear (behind only St James' Park and the Stadium of Light) and the sixth-largest in North East England.\r\n\r\nThe main arena is principally used for athletics. The inaugural athletics competition at the redeveloped venue, the 1974 \"Gateshead Games\", was instigated by Brendan Foster, a Gateshead Council employee at that time. By breaking the world record in the men's 3,000 m, Foster brought international publicity to the new stadium and began a tradition of athletics competitions at the venue, which has since hosted the British Grand Prix (2003–10) and the European Team Championships in 1989, 2000 and 2013. It is the only venue to have hosted the latter event three times. Five world records have been set at the stadium, including two by pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva and a tied 100 metres record by Asafa Powell in 2006.\r\n\r\nAlthough the venue primarily caters for athletics, it is the current or former home to teams in several sports. Gateshead football club have played their home games at the stadium since 1970. Gateshead International Stadium was home to the Gateshead Thunder rugby league club during their spell in the Super League and the replacement Gateshead Thunder club played home games in the main arena, which was known as the Thunderdome when used by that team until the club relocated to Newcastle in 2015. Gateshead Harriers Athletic Club, which includes Foster and Jonathan Edwards among its life members, are the oldest tenants, having used the site since 1956. The stadium has also been used as a concert venue by numerous musical artists including Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams and Tina Turner.","strStadiumLocation":"Neilson Road, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear","intStadiumCapacity":"11800","strWebsite":"www.gateshead-fc.com","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Gateshead Football Club is a professional association football club based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England. The club participates in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. Their most recent notable events include a visit to Wembley, in the play-off final in 2013\/14, and reaching the FA Cup 3rd round in 2014\/2015. The club is very popular among Newcastle United fans and Sunderland fans alike, but also have their own specific fan base famously calling themselves the 'Heed Army'.\r\n\r\nAlthough the club was formed in 1977, it can trace its roots back to 1889. Then, South Shields Adeleide, located eight miles (14 km) from Gateshead, were formed. They originally played in the Northern Alliance before joining the North Eastern Leagues and changing name to just South Shields. They joined the extended Football League Second Division in 1919–20. The mid-to-late 1920s saw the club struggling financially before in 1928 the club finished bottom and were relegated to the Third Division (North). After two unsuccessful seasons in the lower division, the struggling club took the step of not just leaving the Horsley Hill ground but of moving the club to another town in search of more support. Newcastle upon Tyne, was mentioned as a possible destination, but Gateshead was eventually chosen, mainly due to the enthusiastic support of the Gateshead Council.\r\n\r\nThe 'new' club, Gateshead A.F.C., stayed in the Football League until 1960 when they failed to win re-election after finishing in the bottom three of Division Four. They played in various regional leagues before becoming founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968, staying for just two seasons before finishing bottom and again failing to win re-election. They joined the Midland League in 1971 but in August 1973 the club ran into financial problems and were liquidated.\r\n\r\nIn 1974, history repeated itself. A second South Shields FC, formed in 1936, after the previous incarnation had made the afore-mentioned move, also made the move to Gateshead, becoming Gateshead United. United however were not around for too long, being wound up in 1977.\r\n\r\nIn 1977, a new club was formed – Gateshead F.C.. The club were immediately accepted into the Northern Premier League. By this time, their home ground, the Gateshead Youth Stadium, had been upgraded and renamed as Gateshead International Stadium with facilities good enough for a higher grade of football.\r\n\r\nAfter six years Gateshead won promotion from the Northern Premier League to the Alliance Premier League in 1983, with a record tally of points and goals scored. With a relatively lucrative sponsorship, Gateshead spent several seasons in the Football Conference. However, the sponsorship money dried up, and the club started to decline, spending the 2003–04 season in the Northern Premier League First Division. A 6th-place finish was enough to gain promotion to the Premier Division due to the restructuring of the National League System.\r\n\r\nA new board was appointed under the Chairmanship of Graham Wood, which saw Gateshead regain its momentum with the appointment of Ian Bogie as manager. On 3 May 2008, Gateshead beat Buxton 2–0 in the Northern Premier League Premier Division Play-Off Final and were, therefore, promoted to the recently formed Conference North.\r\n\r\nGateshead F.C. absorbed local club Low Fell Juniors to form Gateshead Juniors from the start of the 2008\/09 season, expanding the number of teams under the club banner.\r\n\r\nGateshead finished the 2008–09 season in the Conference North in second (2nd) place. They qualified for the play-offs along with Alfreton Town, Telford United and their semi-final opponents Southport. Gateshead beat Southport 2–1 on aggregate and won the Play-Off Final 1–0 against Telford, earning promotion back to the Conference Premier where they remain.\r\n\r\nGateshead announced on 13 October 2009 that they would be moving to a full-time employed playing squad for the beginning of the 2010–2011 season.\r\n\r\nOn 10 December 2012, manager Ian Bogie and assistant Terry Mitchell were relieved of their duties at the club. Reserve team manager Anth Smith named caretaker manager. Three days later, Smith was named permanent manager and given a contract until the end of the 2012–13 season. On 18 August 2013, David Rush, Smith's assistant, was named as caretaker manager after his resignation, before former York City manager Gary Mills was appointed on 3 September 2013. Mills took Gateshead to third place in the Conference at the end of his first season as manager, qualifying the team for the end-of-season promotion play-offs. An aggregate win over Grimsby Town took Gateshead to their first appearance at Wembley Stadium. However, on 18 May 2014, they lost 2–1 to Cambridge United, who were promoted back into the Football League after a nine-season absence. Gateshead are currently focusing on getting into the Football League.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/maxonw1486738829.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134230","idSoccerXML":"685","idAPIfootball":"1347","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Gillingham","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Gillingham Football Club","intFormedYear":"1893","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English League 1","idLeague":"4396","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Priestfield Stadium","strKeywords":"The Gills","strRSS":"http:\/\/www.gillinghamfootballclub.com\/common\/rss\/news-rss-feed.xml","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/agupxq1511440598.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Priestfield Stadium (popularly known simply as Priestfield and officially known from 2007 to 2010 as KRBS Priestfield Stadium and from 2011 as MEMS Priestfield Stadium for sponsorship purposes) is a football stadium in Gillingham, Kent.

The club is located at Blundell Park where it has been since 1898.\r\n\r\nDespite recent misfortune, including successive playoff failures, the club is the most successful of the three professional league clubs in historic Lincolnshire, being the only one to play top-flight football. It is also the only club of the three to reach an FA Cup semi-final (doing so on two occasions) and is the only one to succeed in two finals at the old Wembley Stadium. It has also spent more time in the English game's first and second tiers than any other club from Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\nNotable managers include Bill Shankly, who went on to guide Liverpool to three League titles, two FA Cups and a UEFA Cup triumph and Lawrie McMenemy who, after securing promotion to the then third division in 1972, moved to Southampton where he won the FA Cup in 1976. Alan Buckley is the club's most successful manager; he had three spells as team manager between 1988 and 2008, guiding the club to three promotions and two appearances at Wembley Stadium during the 1997–98 season winning both the Football League Trophy and the Football League Second Division Play-Off Final. In 2008 Buckley took Grimsby to the capital again, but lost out to MK Dons in the final of the Football League Trophy. The Mariners had also reached the Football League Two Play-Off final in 2006 at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, but lost the match 1–0 to Cheltenham Town, and in 2013 they returned to Wembley only to be defeated by Wrexham in the FA Trophy final.

The new club took Edmonton's place in Division One of the Athenian League, and adopted their current name after finishing bottom of the division in 1975–76. The league was reduced to a single division in 1977 and the club finished bottom of the league in 1981–82.\r\n\r\nWhen the Athenian League was disbanded at the end of the 1983–84 season, Haringey joined Division Two North of the Isthmian League. With many of the players and the management team leaving shortly before the start of the 1988–89 season, the club dropped out of the league, before joining the Premier Division of the Spartan League for the 1989–90 season. In 1990–91 the club won the London Senior Cup. In 1995 they were renamed Tufnell Park, taking the name of one of the clubs that had merged to form Edmonton, but reverted to the Haringey Borough name the following year. When the Spartan League merged with the South Midlands League in 1997 to form the Spartan South Midlands League, the club were placed in Premier Division South for the 1997–98 season; a seventh-place finish saw them placed in the Premier Division for the following season.\r\n\r\nHaringey were relegated to Division One at the end of the 2006–07 season, which had seen them finish bottom of the Premier Division. However, they were Division One runners-up the following season, earning an immediate promotion back to the Premier Division; the season also saw them win the Division One Cup. In 2011–12 the club won the league's Challenge Trophy. At the end of the season they were transferred to the Essex Senior League, where their Coles Park tenants Greenhouse London also played. The 2014–15 season saw the club win the Essex Senior League, earning promotion to Division One North of the Isthmian League.\r\n\r\nIn 2016–17 Haringey finished fifth in Division One North, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, they lost 5–4 to Maldon & Tiptree in the semi-finals. The club finished fourth in the division the following season, and after beating Heybridge Swifts 2–0 in the semi-finals, they won the final 3–1 against Canvey Island to secure promotion to the Premier Division. The 2018–19 season saw the club reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, going on to lose 1–0 at home to AFC Wimbledon. In October 2019, the Haringey players left the pitch during an FA Cup fourth qualifying round game against Yeovil Town after the Haringey goalkeeper, Valery Pajetat, was reportedly spat at and hit by an object thrown from the Yeovil Town end. The Metropolitan Police announced their intention to investigate the incident.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/iyyau31579099527.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"136009","idSoccerXML":"4775","idAPIfootball":"4705","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Harrow Borough","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1933","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English Southern Premier League South Division","idLeague":"4648","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Earlsmead Stadium","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"Harrow Borough play their home games at Earlsmead Stadium.

It has been the home ground of Ipswich Town F.C. since 1884. The stadium has also hosted a number of England youth international matches, and one senior England friendly international match, against Croatia in 2003. It has staged several other sporting events, including athletics meetings and international hockey matches.\r\n\r\nThe stadium underwent significant redevelopments in the early 2000s, which increased the capacity from 22,600 to a current figure of 30,311, making it the largest capacity football ground in East Anglia. Each of its four stands have since been converted to all-seater, following the recommendations of the Taylor Report. Also located at the ground are conference and banqueting facilities, the Sir Bobby Robson Suite, Legends Bar and a club store selling Ipswich Town merchandise.\r\n\r\nIpswich played their early matches at Broomhill Park, but in 1884, the club moved to Portman Road and have played there ever since. The ground was also used as a cricket pitch during the summer by the East Suffolk Cricket Club who had played there since 1855. The cricket club had erected a pavilion, the first fixed building at the ground. More substantial elements of ground development did not begin for a further 11 years, though Ipswich became one of the first clubs to implement the use of goal nets in 1890. At this time, Ipswich were an amateur side (the team became professional in 1936) and the first visit of a professional club came in 1892, when Preston North End played a Suffolk County Football Association team. This was followed six years later by a visit from Aston Villa, a game which was so popular that a temporary stand was erected in order to accommodate a crowd of around 5,000. In 1901, a tobacco processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground by the Churchman brothers, a name which would later become synonymous with the south stand located there.\r\n\r\nThe first permanent stand, a wooden structure known affectionately as the \"Chicken Run\", was built on the Portman Road side of the ground in 1906.

In 1998–99, the club won a continental treble of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League.\r\n\r\nThe 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United was the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 28 major honours, and 38 in total, from November 1986 to May 2013, when he announced his retirement after 26 years at the club. On 19 May 2014, Louis van Gaal was appointed as the club's new manager after Ferguson's successor David Moyes was sacked after only 10 months in charge, with the club's record appearance-maker, Ryan Giggs, appointed as his assistant after a brief period as caretaker manager.\r\n\r\nManchester United is the third-richest football club in the world for 2011–12 in terms of revenue, with an annual revenue of €395.9 million, and the world's second most valuable sports team in 2013, valued at $3.165 billion. It is one of the most widely supported football teams in the world. After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800 million, after which the company was taken private again. In August 2012, Manchester United made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":"El Manchester United Football Club, mejor conocido como Manchester United, es un club de fútbol de la ciudad de Mánchester, Inglaterra, Reino Unido, que disputa sus partidos como local en el estadio Old Trafford.\r\n\r\nNació bajo la denominación «Newton Heath LYR Football Club» en 1878, siendo el equipo del depósito ferroviario Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, ubicado en Newton Heath. El club se incorporó a la First Division en 1892. Tras estar cerca de la bancarrota en 1902, J. H. Davies tomó las riendas del club y cambió el nombre, llamándolo Manchester United. Su estadio fue bombardeado durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial lo que motivó al club a buscar la caridad de sus vecinos del Manchester City, quienes les permitieron jugar en Maine Road durante un tiempo a cambio de un costo anual. El United nombró a Matt Busby como entrenador del equipo tras la guerra y su política, por entonces inaudita, de la promoción de la mayor parte de los jugadores del equipo juvenil del club tuvo un gran éxito, al ganar la liga en 1956 y 1957.9 Este éxito tuvo un alto en el camino con el desastre aéreo de Múnich de 1958, en el que ocho jugadores del equipo perdieron la vida.10 11 A pesar de dicha tragedia, el conjunto supo recuperarse y ganó la liga en 1965 y 1967, así como la Copa Europea en 1968. El club no tuvo de nuevo un éxito tan notable hasta la década de 1990, cuando Alex Ferguson dirigió al equipo a la obtención de ocho campeonatos ligueros en once años. En 1999, el Manchester United se convirtió en el primer equipo inglés en ganar la Champions, la Premier League y la FA Cup en la misma temporada —el «triplete» del club—.12\r\n\r\nEntre sus principales logros a nivel nacional se encuentran haber ganado la First Division\/Premier League en 20 ocasiones, la FA Cup en 11 y la Supercopa de Inglaterra en 20, récords absolutos en los tres casos, además de cuatro ediciones de la Copa de la Liga de Inglaterra. A nivel europeo, ha obtenido tres veces la Liga de Campeones, empatado en séptimo lugar y segundo mejor inglés, además de una Recopa de Europa.13 Es el único club inglés en convertirse en campeón mundial de clubes, al conquistar la Copa Intercontinental en 1999 y la Copa Mundial de Clubes de la FIFA en 2008, tras derrotar a los entonces campeones de América Palmeiras y Liga de Quito, respectivamente.\r\n\r\nLos principales rivales del Manchester United han sido el Liverpool y Manchester City, a quien se enfrenta en el derby de Manchester.\r\n\r\nEn la cultura popular, es considerado como uno de los más populares del mundo,14 debido a que cuenta con 659 millones de seguidores a nivel internacional hasta mayo de 2012, según una investigación realizada por la empresa Kantar. De esta cifra, 325 millones provienen del continente asiático, 173 millones del Oriente Medio y África, 90 millones de Europa y finalmente 71 millones de América. De igual manera, ha tenido el promedio de asistencia más alto en el fútbol inglés desde 1957, salvo algunas excepciones en que ha sido superado por el Tottenham, Everton y Liverpool.17\r\n\r\nFinancieramente, el United se convirtió en el primer equipo deportivo en superar un valor de 3 000 millones USD, para ser catalogada de esta forma como la franquicia deportiva mejor valuada del mundo, de acuerdo a la revista Forbes, un hito que sería superado un par de meses después por el también club de fútbol Real Madrid, con un valor de 3 300 millones USD. Hay que señalar que el club inglés encabezaba el listado de los equipos de fútbol más valuados del mundo desde 2004.","strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/xzqdr11517660252.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133612-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/rwwxyv1421429574.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wtquqy1424229431.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/rxsyvv1420244538.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qxxsxu1424229449.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/quuytw1424229564.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/qyttpp1447343417.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC6yW44UGJJBvYTlfC7CRg2Q","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134381","idSoccerXML":"837","idAPIfootball":"1374","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Mansfield","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Mansfield Town","intFormedYear":"1897","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English League 2","idLeague":"4397","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Field Mill","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/qicmd11526388898.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Field Mill, currently known as One Call Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is a football ground in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, England, and the home of Mansfield Town Football Club.\r\n\r\nIt is the oldest ground in the Football League, hosting football since 1861, although some reports date it back as far as 1850.

Its current capacity is 34,742 all seated, although there is provisional planning permission in place to expand that to 42,000 if required.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was built to replace Ayresome Park after the Taylor Report, which required all top division football stadia to be all-seater. After the report was delivered in January 1990, Middlesbrough needed an all-seater stadium by August 1994, and were unable to expand Ayresome Park outwards owing to its location in a residential area, and expanding the stadium upwards would have limited the club to a capacity of around 20,000 seats – the club wanted a considerably larger capacity. The decision was taken by club officials to build a new stadium; Teesside Development Corporation offered them the Middlehaven site by the River Tees for development.\r\n\r\nThe new 30,000 seater stadium was constructed by Taylor Woodrow Construction for £16 million, taking 32 weeks to complete after work began in the autumn of 1994. The name of the stadium was chosen by the club's fans, following a vote during the final game at Ayresome Park. The other choices available were Middlehaven Stadium, Erimus Stadium and Teesside Stadium. When first opened, the name was amended to Cellnet Riverside Stadium (and then BT Cellnet Riverside Stadium) as part of a £3 million sponsorship deal with Cellnet, but this deal ended after the 2001–02 season.\r\n\r\nThe first game was played against Chelsea in front of a 28,286 crowd (the highest home attendance in 14 years) on 26 August 1995. Middlesbrough won the game 2–0, with Craig Hignett taking the honour of scoring the first ever goal at the stadium, Jan Åge Fjørtoft scoring the second. Their first season at their new stadium was also their first back in the FA Premier League following promotion after two seasons away.\r\n\r\nIn their second season at the Riverside Stadium, Middlesbrough were runners-up in both of the domestic cups but a points deduction in the league meant that they were relegated from the Premier League.\r\n\r\nIn 1998 – when Middlesbrough were promoted back to the Premier League at the first attempt – the capacity was increased by 5,000 by filling in the north and south-west corners at a cost of £5 million.

It is situated in South Bermondsey, South East London, almost directly adjacent to the railway line between London Bridge and New Cross Gate, and the SELCHP incinerator. It is under a quarter of a mile away from The Old Den. Built on a previous site of housing, a church and the Senegal Fields playing fields, it has an all-seated capacity of 20,146, with the average attendance for the 2010-11 season being 12,438. The Den is the sixth ground that Millwall have occupied since their formation as a football club in the Millwall area of the Isle of Dogs in 1885.\r\nThe Den was the first new all seater stadium to be completed after the Taylor Report on the Hillsborough disaster. It was designed with effective crowd management in mind (given Millwall's crowd problems at The Old Den), with the escape routes being short and direct. After chairman Reg Burr decided that it would not be viable to redevelop The Den as an all-seater stadium, he announced during 1990 that Millwall would be relocating to a new stadium in the Senegal Fields area. Originally, it was planned to have a seating capacity of between 25,000 to 30,000. Millwall however, could not meet the additional cost.\r\n\r\nView from the West lower stand against Charlton Athletic during a 4-0 win in the 09-10 season.\r\nMillwall played their final game on 8 May 1993 at The Old Den after 83 years, and moved to the new 20,000 all-seater stadium a quarter of a mile away from Cold Blow Lane. The £16 million Den was opened by John Smith MP (leader of the Labour Party and Opposition at the time) on 4 August 1993 prior to a prestigious friendly against Sporting Lisbon which Sporting won by 2-1. The Den was the first new football stadium constructed for a professional team in London since 1937.\r\n\r\nMillwall have experienced mixed fortunes since relocating to The Den. Their first season at the stadium (1993-94) saw them finish third in Division One—their highest finish since relegation from the top flight four years earlier. However, their dreams of Premier League football were ended by a defeat in the playoffs and they were relegated to Division Two in 1996, not winning promotion from that level until 2001. They came close to reaching the Premier League again in 2002, finishing fourth but once again losing in the playoffs. The Lions reached the FA Cup final for the first time in 2004, and despite a 3-0 defeat by Manchester United they qualified for a European competition for the very first time (although their UEFA Cup campaign was short lived). Relegation from the newly named Football League Championship (second highest division in England) followed in 2006. They were promoted back to the N-Power Championship, via a 1-0 win against Swindon Town at Wembley in 2010.","strStadiumLocation":"Bermondsey, London, England","intStadiumCapacity":"20146","strWebsite":"www.millwallfc.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/MillwallFCOfficial","strTwitter":"www.twitter.com\/MillwallFC","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/millwallfcinsta","strDescriptionEN":"Millwall Football Club (\/ˈmɪlwɔːl\/ or locally ) is an English professional football club based in New Cross, south-east London, that plays in the Football League Championship, the second tier of English football.

The local derby between the two sides has been contested almost 100 times since 1899. In the media, Millwall's supporters have often been associated with hooliganism, with numerous films having been made fictionalising their notoriety. The fans are renowned for their chant \"No one likes us, we don't care\" which is sung to the tune of Sailing by Rod Stewart.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, the team reached the final of the FA Cup and, in doing so, qualified for the UEFA Cup the following season, playing in Europe for the first time in their history. The club has also reached FA Cup semi-finals on another four occasions, in 1900, 1903, 1937 and 2013.

Designed by Populous, it has completed phase one construction by civil engineering company Buckingham Group Contracting. It is the home ground of Milton Keynes Dons FC.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was officially opened on 29 November 2007 by the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe current configuration of the stadium uses two tiers which hold a capacity of 30,500. Should it be required, there is the option to increase the capacity of the stadium again to 45,000 with the addition of a third tier, hence the high roof. The design will comply with UEFA's Elite Stadium specifications and includes a Desso GrassMaster playing surface.\r\n\r\nThe plans of the complex include an indoor arena, arena:mk, that was to be the home of the Marshall Milton Keynes Lions professional basketball team from 2008. However, the retail developments that would have provided enabling funding have been deferred due to the national economic situation, leaving the Lions without a home. Following the conclusion of the 2011-12 season, despite pleas to many local businesses, the Lions could not secure a venue within Milton Keynes, resulting in a move south to the Copper Box, a multi-sport venue that was used for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Lions played their first game at the Copper Box on 14 August 2013 in front of a sell-out crowd.\r\n\r\nIn addition to association football, the stadium is occasionally host to rugby union. In May 2008, Saracens (who at the time groundshared with Watford at Vicarage Road) played Bristol at stadiummk because Watford needed their ground for a Championship play-off. In 2011, Northampton Saints RFC used the ground for their Heineken Cup quarter and semi final matches because their home ground is too small for major events. Saracens once again visited for their home Aviva Premiership fixture against Northampton Saints on 30 December 2012 while their new stadium at Barnet Copthall was still being built. The stadium will host 3 matches in the 2015 Rugby World Cup.","strStadiumLocation":"Denbigh, Milton Keynes","intStadiumCapacity":"30500","strWebsite":"www.mkdons.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/pages\/MK-Dons-Official\/110525819021577","strTwitter":"www.twitter.com\/MKDonsFC","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Milton Keynes Dons Football Club (\/ˌmɪltən ˈkiːnz ˈdɒnz\/), usually abbreviated to MK Dons, is a professional association football club based in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England.

The club achieved its first success by winning the Worcestershire Senior Cup in 1894 and becoming runners-up in 1898. In 1914 they won the Birmingham Combination Championship for the first time and, finally, the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1925. The 1930s were a much more rewarding period for the club and its supporters, starting by winning the Worcestershire Senior Cup and the Birmingham Senior Cup in successive seasons. Reds almost achieved a notable double in 1932–33 when, having won the Combination, they were defeated in the Senior Cup Final.\r\n\r\nApart from an unsuccessful appearance in the Birmingham Senior Cup final just before the World War, Reds moved into a fallow period. In 1953 Redditch regained the Combination Championship and were runners-up in the Worcestershire Senior Cup. This Championship success was repeated in 1955. In 1957 they were runners-up in the Birmingham Senior Cup.\r\n\r\nSouthern League\r\nIn 1971–72 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 6–0 in the replay at Peterborough United after a 1–1 draw at home in front of a crowd of 4,500 . At the end of the season they finished sixth in the West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division and joined Division One North of the Southern League.\r\n\r\nThey won the Worcestershire Senior Cup in 1974 and 1975. The following season they won Division One North and were promoted to the Premier Division. In 1978–79 they finished eighth in the league, and became founder members of the Alliance Premier League (now the Football Conference). However, they finished bottom in its first season, and dropped into the Southern League's Midland Division.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing as runners-up in 1985–86, the club were promoted to the Premier Division, where they remained until relegation in 1989. The following season, they reached the first round of the FA Cup, losing 3–1 to Merthyr Tydfil. At the end of the season they beat Northwich Victoria 4–3 over the two-legged final of the Staffordshire Senior Cup.\r\n\r\nIn 1997–98 the Reds reached two cup finals, the Southern League Cup and the Birmingham Senior Cup. Both were lost, and the cup run caused a large fixture backlog that resulted in the club having to play nine matches in nine days at the end of the season.\r\n\r\nIn 2003–04 the club won the Southern League Western Division.

Opened in July 2012, it is the home ground of Rotherham United F.C. \r\nRotherham United announced their intention to construct a new community stadium when they moved away from Millmoor to the Don Valley Stadium in May 2008 after a dispute with the ground owner Ken Booth. In January 2010 the club purchased the former site of the Guest and Chrimes Foundry to be used for the new stadium. Outline planning permission for the stadium was granted in November 2010, and the first images were sketched shortly after.\r\n\r\nThe name of the stadium was announced as the 'New York Stadium' on 19 December 2011, chosen ahead of 'The Foundry' and 'The Waterfront Stadium'. The reason for the name is that the area of land that the stadium lies upon is called New York, and it was thought that it would be better to name the stadium after history and\/or where the stadium is situated, like nearby stadiums Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team.\r\n\r\nConstruction started in June 2011 and the stadium was officially opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 12 March 2012. The first game played at the stadium was a pre-season match between Rotherham and Barnsley, held on 21 July 2012. The Millers won 2–1; the first goal in the stadium was scored by Jacob Mellis of Barnsley, and David Noble scored Rotherham's first goal in their new home. The New York Stadium made its league debut on 18 August 2012, in which Rotherham beat Burton Albion 3-0, Daniel Nardiello scoring the first competitive goal in the ground.\r\n\r\nOn 16 April 2014, the stadium held an England under-18s game for the first time.

They joined The Football League three years later and were also one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992.\r\n\r\nSince joining the Football League in 1892, the club has spent most of its history in the top flight of English football but have not played at this level since being relegated in 2000. They have won four League titles, three FA Cups and one League Cup in 1991, their only major trophy since 1935. They reached the FA Cup and League Cup Finals in 1993 but lost both to Arsenal. They also lost the 1966 FA Cup final to Everton.\r\n\r\nSince 1899, Sheffield Wednesday have played home matches at Hillsborough Stadium in the north-western suburb of Owlerton, hence their nickname The Owls. Hillsborough is currently an all-seater ground with a capacity of 39,732.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/vttpyw1464537789.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/xwwttw1454114781.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/ezcjrx1509012679.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/tmhry31537306369.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/kju3ea1537306382.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/kttynv1537306395.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/no7c891537306408.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/qgowd31537306916.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/officialswfc","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134417","idSoccerXML":"877","idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Shortwood","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":null,"intFormedYear":null,"strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"_No League","idLeague":"4367","strDivision":null,"strManager":null,"strStadium":"The Meadowbank Ground","strKeywords":null,"strRSS":null,"strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":null,"intStadiumCapacity":null,"strWebsite":"http:\/\/www.pitchero.com\/clubs\/shortwoodunited\/","strFacebook":null,"strTwitter":null,"strInstagram":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/6zjqbi1520796279.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134377","idSoccerXML":"833","idAPIfootball":"1352","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Shrewsbury","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Shrewsbury Town","intFormedYear":"1886","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English League 1","idLeague":"4396","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"New Meadow","strKeywords":"The Shrews, STFC","strRSS":"http:\/\/www.shrewsburytown.com\/common\/rss\/news-rss-feed.xml","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/b0lbmd1514390395.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"The New Meadow, also known as the Greenhous Meadow for sponsorship purposes, is the home ground of English football club Shrewsbury Town.\r\n\r\nThe stadium is situated on the southern outskirts of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, between the districts of Meole Brace and Sutton Farm, and close to the A5.

The Stadium is still in existence, but has since fallen into a state of serious disrepair. During the next four seasons (2003–04 to 2006–07) the club was based in Windsor, ground-sharing with Windsor & Eton at their Stag Meadow ground. In the summer of 2007, the club agreed a three-year ground-share with Beaconsfield SYCOB. This was extended to cover the 2010–11 season, and continued until Slough moved into their new ground, Arbour Park, on 29 August 2016.\r\n\r\nIn June 2009, Slough Town made a proposal that was submitted to Slough Borough Council for permission to build a new stadium within the Borough of Slough. The proposed location for the development was the Arbour Vale school site on Stoke Road, to the north of the town. In addition to a state-of-the-art stadium, the plans included affordable housing and sports fields.  An artist's impression of the new ground was released in March 2012.

The stadium has a capacity of 32,505 and is currently the largest football stadium in the South of England (excluding London).\r\nSince the 1980s, when Southampton regularly challenged the best sides in the English league (particularly in 1984 when they were league runners-up), there had been talk of the club relocating to a new stadium to replace The Dell due to the old stadium's cramped location which made it unsuitable for major expansion work.\r\n\r\nWhen the Taylor Report on 29 January 1990 required all First and Second Division clubs to have all-seater stadiums by August 1994, Southampton's directors initially decided to upgrade The Dell into an all-seater stadium (which was completed in 1993) but speculation about relocation continued, especially as an all-seater Dell had a capacity of just over 15,000; despite this, Southampton continued to defy the odds and survive in the new FA Premier League after 1992.\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to build a new 25,000 seater stadium and leisure complex at Stoneham, on the outskirts of Southampton, the city council offered the club the chance to build a new ground on the disused gas work site in the heart of the city, about one and half miles from The Dell.\r\n\r\nThe move was cited as the club returning home, because the club was formed by members of the nearby St. Mary's Church, as the football team of St. Mary's Church Young Men's Association before becoming Southampton St. Mary's F.C., and eventually Southampton F.C.\r\n\r\nConstruction started in December 1999 and was completed at the end of July 2001, with work on the stadium itself and improvements to local infrastructure cost a total of £32 million.\r\n\r\nThe Saints have been in residence since August 2001 when they moved from The Dell, which for the final years of its life, held just over 15,000 spectators – less than half the size of the new stadium. The first match was played on 1 August 2001 against RCD Espanyol, with the Spanish side winning 4–3.\r\n\r\nThe first competitive hat trick at the stadium was scored by Stafford Browne for Aldershot Town in a 3–1 victory over Havant & Waterlooville in the Hampshire Senior Cup final on 1 May 2002.","strStadiumLocation":"Britannia Rd, Southampton, England","intStadiumCapacity":"32505","strWebsite":"www.saintsfc.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/southamptonfc","strTwitter":"www.twitter.com\/southamptonfc","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/southamptonfc","strDescriptionEN":"Southampton Football Club Listeni\/saʊθˈæmptən, -hæmptən\/ is an English football club, nicknamed The Saints, based in the city of Southampton, Hampshire, who currently compete in the Premier League.\r\n\r\nThe Saints' home ground since 2001 has been St Mary's Stadium, before which they were based at The Dell.

Tennant did not appear, his place taken by Alf Fearn who was usually a half-back with the reserves. Dulwich put eight goals past him, the winning goal coming in near darkness at the end of extra time. What put the game in the record books was that City scored seven times, with all seven goals being scored by Wilfred Minter. His feat remains the highest tally by a player on the losing side of an FA Cup tie.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/omqxuu1545079557.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"135976","idSoccerXML":"1377","idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Staines Town","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":null,"intFormedYear":null,"strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"_No League","idLeague":"4367","strDivision":null,"strManager":null,"strStadium":"Wheatsheaf Park","strKeywords":null,"strRSS":null,"strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":null,"intStadiumCapacity":null,"strWebsite":"http:\/\/stainestownfootballclub.co.uk\/","strFacebook":null,"strTwitter":null,"strInstagram":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/jz0rjm1572164271.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"135974","idSoccerXML":"1375","idAPIfootball":"7749","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Stalybridge","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"0","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English Northern Premier League Premier Division","idLeague":"4646","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Bower Fold","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"www.stalybridgeceltic.co.uk\/index.php","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":null,"strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":null,"strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"136006","idSoccerXML":"4772","idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Stamford AFC","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1896","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"_No League","idLeague":"4367","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Zeeco Stadium","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"Stamford","intStadiumCapacity":"2000","strWebsite":"www.stamfordafc.net","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Stamford Association Football Club is an English association football club based in Stamford, Lincolnshire and are currently members of the Premier Division of the Northern Premier League.

It has been the home ground of Stevenage (formerly Stevenage Borough) since 1980, and has a capacity of 6,722 people, including 3,142 seats.\r\n\r\nThe club plays at Broadhall Way, previously home to Stevenage Town and Stevenage Athletic. Following the bankruptcy of the town's former club, the stadium was not used for three years. The newly formed Stevenage Borough had planned on playing Hitchin Town Youth at Broadhall Way in November 1976 as a \"curtain-raiser\" for the new venture. Volunteers prepared the pitch in anticipation, but their plans were scuppered when the ex-chairman of Stevenage Athletic — and stadium lease-holder — desecrated the playing surface at Broadhall Way by digging a trench across the full length of the pitch. However, the club eventually moved into Broadhall Way in 1980 as a result of the council re-purchasing the stadium, and allowed the football club to become its tenant.\r\n\r\nFollowing Stevenage's successful 1995–96 Conference National campaign, the Hertfordshire side were denied promotion to the Football League because of insufficient ground capacity and facilities. Consequently, in the early 2000s, the ground was upgraded, with a new £600,000 stand opening, and work on a £5million training facility was announced for nearby Shephalbury Park — which subsequently opened in Autumn 2002. In June 2011, the club secured a 40-acre former sports ground in Bragbury End — with the intention of developing the site into a new training complex. Work began on the development in the summer of 2011, and the staff began to use the complex towards the latter stages of the 2012–13 season.\r\n\r\nIn January 2009, Stevenage announced that they had signed a seven-figure sponsorship deal with the Lamex Food Group, resulting in the renaming of Broadhall Way to The Lamex Stadium. As a result of the club securing promotion as league champions during the club's 2009–10 campaign, Broadhall Way hosted League football for the first ever time during the 2010–11 season. The stadium now has a capacity of 6,722 people, including 3,142 seats. The capacity was reduced from 7,100 following the club's promotion to the Football League.","strStadiumLocation":"Stevenage, Hertfordshire","intStadiumCapacity":"6722","strWebsite":"www.stevenagefc.com\/page\/Home\/0,,10839,00.html","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Stevenage Football Club (known as Stevenage Borough Football Club until 2010) is a professional association football club based in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.

Following three promotions in four seasons in the early 1990s, the club were promoted to the Conference National in 1994.

Stevenage were finally promoted to the Football League after winning the Conference National in the 2009–10 season. On securing Football League status, the club dropped the word 'Borough' from its title. Stevenage earned back-to-back promotions when they beat Torquay United 1–0 at Old Trafford in the 2010–11 play-off final.\r\n\r\nThe club has also enjoyed success in national cup competitions in recent years, becoming the first team to win a competitive final at the new Wembley Stadium in 2007, beating Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 to lift the FA Trophy in front of a competition record crowd of 53,262.

The stand's red and blue seats, which do not reflect the club's colours, were donated by Chelsea.\r\n\r\nAccess to the ground for most match day supporters continues to be through \"Ellison's patent rush preventative turnstiles\", which were manufactured by W.T. Ellison & Co of Salford, Lancashire between 1898 and 1963. Similar turnstiles were installed at the original Wembley Stadium in 1923.\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, two small wooden stands were replaced by a covered standing terrace, known as the \"Rec Terrace\" because it is on the Collingwood Recreation Ground side of the pitch, on top of which is a covered television filming box used by SUFCtv. A small remnant of one of the original wooden stands is next to the Rec Terrace and is known by Sutton supporters as \"the shoebox\". Behind this there is a small food hut called \"Rose's Tea Hut\", named after a lady called Rose who ran the hut for over four decades.\r\n\r\nOn 7 January 1989, the Lane hosted an FA Cup match against top division Coventry City, which Sutton won to create one of the biggest upsets in FA Cup history, in front of a sell-out crowd of approximately 8,000 supporters.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, the Gander Green Lane end of the stadium was levelled off and new terracing was installed.\r\n\r\nOn 10 July 2002, the ground played host to AFC Wimbledon's first match following the relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes. In a pre-season friendly, Sutton defeated the reformed Dons 4–0 in front of a notably large crowd of 4,657.\r\n\r\nIn addition to football, the ground was used in the past for athletics. To fix the effects of the terraces being further away from the pitch than usual, in 2014 the ground was refurbished: the athletics track was removed and new dugouts and player tunnels were built; to move some of the stands closer to the pitch, new covered standing terraces were built behind each goal on the eastern and western sides of the pitch. The oval curvature of the two open standing terraces which sweep around the western side of the pitch allude to the ground's former use for athletics.\r\n\r\nOn 22 April 2015, Sutton United announced that Sutton Common Rovers would be ground sharing Gander Green Lane from the start of the 2015–16 season. In the summer of 2015 a new artificial pitch was installed, and was officially opened on 14 July 2015 by Alan Pardew, former manager of Crystal Palace.\r\n\r\nA mural to commemorate Craig Dundas' 400th appearance for the club in a 2–0 home win over Dartford on 23 January 2016 can be seen on the side of a terrace next to Rose's Tea Hut. It shows Dundas celebrating a goal with the number \"400\" in bold black letters.\r\n\r\nGander Green Lane was officially renamed the Knights Community Stadium in 2017 after the club agreed a 3-year sponsorship deal with the Knights Foundation, who in return will be running Sutton United's academy until 2020.\r\n\r\nThe record league match attendance for the ground is 3,198, which was set on 5 August 2017 in a 2-0 victory over Leyton Orient.\r\n\r\nThe main hall, currently known as the Times Square Lounge, is home to the Boom Boom Club music venue.","strStadiumLocation":"Gander Green Lane, Sutton","intStadiumCapacity":"5013","strWebsite":"www.suttonunited.net","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Sutton United Football Club is a football club in Sutton, South London, England, who play in the National League, the fifth tier of English football.

The Coventry team was composed mostly of star international players and had won the competition in 1987.

The club's home ground, where it has played for 120 years since 1896, is the County Ground, which has a capacity of 15,728.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1879, became professional in 1894 and entered the Football League in 1920. It has enjoyed periods of success, most notably during 1968–70, winning the 1969 League Cup by defeating Arsenal at Wembley Stadium and securing promotion to the Second Division. League Cup success earned the club its first invitations to European competitions, but they were not eligible to participate because they played in the then Third Division. So as compensation they were entered into the 1969 Anglo-Italian League Cup and the 1970 Anglo-Italian Cup, with Swindon winning both. These wins were led by the club's talisman winger Don Rogers. The South Stand was named after him from the 2007–08 season.\r\n\r\nThe club's two best wins were 10 goals to 2 over Norwich City on 5 September 1908 and 10 goals to 1 over Farnham United Breweries F.C. in the season of 1925–26 while the worst loss was 10 goal to 1 down against Manchester City in 1930.\r\n\r\nSwindon Town won promotion to the Premier League during the 1992–93 season, the only time the club has played in the top level of English football. Swindon was the second team to win promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs, beating Leicester City. This proved to be Swindon's only season in the top flight to date, in which they conceded 100 goals. However, based on all results during their time in the Premier League and Football League up to 2010–11, Swindon are ranked as the all-time 47th most successful English football club domestically.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/uwsyup1424033445.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/ttpqpy1454115572.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/r5txtu1540560522.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/0w27da1545134187.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/0krhvj1545134195.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/47z8r61545134202.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/5c4hq51545134209.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/8sxr281542661236.jpg","strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"136004","idSoccerXML":"4770","idAPIfootball":"4711","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Taunton Town","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1947","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English Southern Premier League South Division","idLeague":"4648","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"The Viridor Stadium","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"Taunton Town play their home games at Wordsworth Drive, Taunton, Somerset, TA1 2HG\r\n\r\nWhen they were formed, Taunton Town played at a variety of grounds in the Taunton area, including Mountfields, French Weir, Victoria Park and Huish Old Boys.

Tottenham was the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 it became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition – the European Cup Winners' Cup. In 1967 it won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s. In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and was the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies: the FA Cup twice, FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984. In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup. When it won the League Cup once more in 2008, it meant that it had won a major trophy in each of the last six decades – an achievement only matched by Manchester United.\r\n\r\nThe club's Latin motto is Audere est Facere (lit: \"To Dare Is to Do\"), and its emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football.

Founded in 1881 as Watford Rovers, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1886, and the Southern League a decade later. After finishing the 1914–15 season as Southern League champions under the management of Harry Kent, Watford joined the Football League in 1920. The club played at several grounds in its early history, before moving to a permanent location at Vicarage Road in 1922, where it remains to this day. Watford spent most of the following half century in the lower divisions of The Football League, changing colours and crest on multiple occasions.\r\n\r\nEngland manager Graham Taylor saw Watford scale new heights. Between Taylor's appointment in 1977 and departure in 1987, Watford rose from the Fourth Division to the First Division. The team finished second in the First Division in the 1982–83 season, competed in the UEFA Cup in 1983–84, and also reached the 1984 FA Cup Final. Watford experienced a decade of decline between 1987 and 1997, before Taylor returned as full-time manager, leading the team to successive promotions from the renamed Second Division to the Premier League. The club's most recent stint in the top division of English football was during the 2006–07 season, under Aidy Boothroyd's management. In the 2014–15 season, Watford will compete in the Football League Championship – the second highest level of English football.\r\n\r\nWatford is currently owned by the Pozzo family, which also owns Udinese Calcio in Italy and Granada CF in Spain.

The club is affiliated to the Middlesex County Football Association and currently plays in the National League South, the sixth tier of English football. The team play in royal blue shirts, white shorts and royal blue and white socks, and are nicknamed \"The Stones\" or \"The Royals\".\r\n\r\nThe club appeared in the first ever televised football match in 1946, when the BBC showed part of their league match against Barnet. They were also the first ever club to win the non-League 'double', claiming both the FA Trophy and the Alliance Premier League in 1984–85.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed at the start of the 1899–1900 season. Their first game was a friendly match on 7 October 1899 against Northwood, which they won 6–1. They joined Division Two of the Willesden & District League, and were promoted to Division One for the 1900–01 season after Division Two was scrapped. In 1903 they moved to the College Farm Ground in Locket Road In 1905–06 the club won Division One, but on 20 October 1906 a notice was posted in the local newspaper stating that the club was being disbanded due to a lack of interest from players and supporters.\r\n\r\nThe club was reformed in time for the 1908–09 season, rejoining Division One of the Willesden & District League. In 1910 they moved to Belmont Road, and won Division One again in 1912–13. Following World War I the club joined the London League and the Middlesex Senior League. They moved to the Lower Mead ground at the start of the 1922–23 season, when they also switched to the Spartan League. The club had their record win on 13 October 1923, beating the 12th London Regiment 22–0 in an FA Amateur Cup game. In 1928–29 they switched leagues again, this time joining the Athenian League. In 1929–30 the club won the Middlesex Senior Cup and the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup for the first time.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II the club continued to play, playing at Wembley Stadium in the final of the Middlesex Senior Red Cross Cup in 1943. The following year they recorded their heaviest-ever defeat, losing 14–0 to Edgware Town in the London Senior Cup. In 1946 the BBC showed part of Wealdstone's Athenian League match at Barnet, the first time a live match had been televised. The club also appeared in the BBC's first two live FA Cup match broadcasts, with their games against Edgware Town in the third qualifying round and Colchester United in the fourth qualifying round being shown on television during the 1949–50 season. After beating Colchester, Wealdstone reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 1–0 to Port Vale.\r\n\r\nIn 1951–52 the club won the Athenian League, and went on to win the Middlesex Senior Cup in 1959, 1963 and 1964. In 1964 they switched to the Isthmian League. In 1965–66 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 3–1 at Millwall, but went on to win the FA Amateur Cup, beating local rivals Hendon 3–1 in the final. The following season saw Wealdstone entered at the first round of the FA Cup, losing 2–0 at home to Nuneaton Borough.\r\n\r\nThe club joined the Division One North of the Southern League in 1971, turning professional. They were moved to Division One South the following season, and won the division in 1973–74, earning promotion to the Premier Division. In 1977–78 Wealdstone progressed beyond the first round of the FA Cup for the first time; after beating Third Division Hereford United 3–2 at Edgar Street in a first round replay, they went on to defeat Fourth Division Reading 2–1 at home, before losing 4–0 at QPR in the third round.\r\n\r\nIn 1979 the club were founder members of the Alliance Premier League, the new national top division of non-League football. After finishing 19th in 1980–81 they were relegated back to the Southern League, but then made an immediate return after winning the South Division of the Southern League the following season; a play-off ensued against Midland Division champions Nuneaton, with Wealdstone winning on penalties after winning the home leg 2–1 and losing 1–0 away.\r\n\r\nIn 1984–85 the club had its most successful season to date, winning both the Alliance Premier League and the FA Trophy, beating Boston United 2–1 in the final.. This was first ever occasion that the non-league \"double\" had been achieved by any team.\r\n\r\nHowever, a period of sharp decline soon set in; after finishing tenth the following season, they finished 19th in 1986–87, and were eventually relegated from the season after.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the 1990–91 season financial problems led to the club selling their Lower Mead ground, for which they eventually only received a small share of the sale proceeds. They signed up to an expensive groundsharing arrangement at Watford's Vicarage Road, and at the end of the 1991–92 season the club were relegated again, dropping from the Southern League Premier Division into the South Division. In 1993 they moved to the Warren, Yeading's ground. In 1995 the club rejoined the Isthmian League, dropping into Division Three, and moved grounds again, this time sharing at Edgware Town's White Lion Ground. After winning the division in 1996–97, they finished second in Division Two in 1997–98 and were promoted again, this time to Division One. After finishing third in Division One the 1998–99 they were denied promotion to the Premier Division after ground improvements at the White Lion Ground were made six days after the deadline.\r\n\r\nIn 2004 the club were promoted to the Premier Division as a result of the creation of the Conference North and South and winning a play-off against Dulwich Hamlet. In 2005 the club moved to Northwood's Chestnut Avenue ground. In 2006 they were switched to the Southern League Premier Division for a single season, before returning to the Isthmian League.\r\n\r\nIn January 2008, Wealdstone acquired Ruislip Sports and Social club and the associated lease at Ruislip Manor's Grosvenor Vale ground, starting the 2008–09 season there. With the ground share agreement at Northwood coming to an end and still no specific completion date in sight for the club's Prince Edward Playing Field project, Wealdstone instead decided to invest in the Grosvenor Vale stadium to upgrade the playing facilities as a priority, in order to meet the necessary ground grading requirements to play Isthmian League Premier Division football in the 2008–09 season. The Vale continues to be improved with the introduction of new terracing, safety barriers and in 2009 a new covered stand ('Brian Collins' Corner).\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2012 a new club shop was added, along with a new Tea Bar located behind the dug-outs on the half-way line as well as additional raised terracing. In the summer of 2013, the supporters paid for and built a new mobile stand ('Bulla Stand') which has been positioned behind the goal at the old 'Tea Bar' end and more cover has been added at the Gun Turret end ('Roy Couch' stand) providing further covered accommodation for the fans.\r\n\r\nIn 2011–12 the club reached the FA Trophy semi-finals, losing 3–1 to Newport County. They also reached the promotion play-offs in the Premier Division, but lost 2–1 to Lowestoft Town in the semi-finals. The following season saw them losing in the play-off semi finals again, this time against Concord Rangers. However, in 2013–14 the club were Premier Division champions, earning promotion to the Conference South.\r\n\r\nSince moving to Grosvenor Vale, Wealdstone have seen steadily increasing home attendances year on year, and currently has the highest average home attendance for any non-league club in all of North London. During the 2013\/14 season, Wealdstone had the second highest average home attendance in the Isthmian League (after Maidstone United) and the highest average away attendance (closely followed by Maidstone United and Dulwich Hamlet).{{cn}]\r\n\r\nThe summer of 2016 saw the club change ownership when Peter Marsden, previously chairman of Accrington Stanley, took over the club in late July.\r\n\r\nOn 21 August 2017, Gordon Bartlett stepped down as Wealdstone Manager after 22 years. A day later, Bobby Wilkinson, formerly of Hungerford Town, was appointed manager.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/hqy3vu1510314795.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/b6ikey1510314970.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"135960","idSoccerXML":"1360","idAPIfootball":"8664","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Welling United","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1963","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English National League South","idLeague":"4682","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Park View Road","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"Park View Road is home to Conference National semi-professional football club Welling United, and was the ground of their predecessors Bexley United.

It suffered substantial damage during The Blitz of World War II and lay derelict for some years after. This was until a campaign was initiated to reform Bexleyheath & Welling F.C. Crowds soon soared to over 2,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1950 the current main stand was built. Crowds continued to rise in the 1960s and so the main stand was enlarged, and covered terracing was increased. By the 1970s however, the club (which was then known as Bexley United) had fallen on tough times and were forced to fold. The last game was in April 1976.\r\n\r\nIn 1977, Welling United (who had been playing in nearby Eltham) secured a 15-year lease of the ground. It had been left to rot and a fire had damaged the main stand.\r\n\r\nErith & Belvedere F.C. moved into the ground in 1999 after the main stand at their old stadium – also known as Park View – burnt down.

The club's first team play in the National League South, the sixth tier of English football.\r\n\r\nWelling United Football Club was founded in 1963. It began as a youth team, playing in the Eltham & District Sunday League on a park pitch from 1963–64 to 1970–71. From 1971–72 to 1974–75, it played in the Metropolitan-London League Intermediate\/Reserves Division. In 1975–76 it played in the London Spartan League Reserve Division One. It gained senior status in the London Spartan League in 1976, at Butterfly Lane, Eltham. It finished sixth in Division 2 in 1976–77 and was promoted to the Premier Division. In 1977 Welling moved to the Park View Road ground, which had previously belonged to the then defunct Bexley United. It joined the Athenian League in 1978. In 1981 it progressed to the Southern Football League Southern Division.\r\n\r\nAfter just one season at this level the club found itself in the Southern League Premier Division after the league was re-organised. In 1985–86 it won the league title by 23 points and were promoted to the Football Conference.\r\n\r\nAlthough it struggled in the Conference, only twice finishing above 11th place in 14 seasons, it did enjoy cup success during this period, reaching the first round proper of the FA Cup in six successive seasons, on one occasion knocking out Kent's only Football League side, Gillingham. It also made one third round appearance, losing 1–0 at Park View Road to Blackburn Rovers.\r\n\r\nThe club was relegated in 1999–2000 and returned to the Southern League.\r\n\r\nIn the 2003–04 season, under the management of former England World Cup player Paul Parker, the Wings finished in the top half of the Southern League Premier Division and was therefore able to claim a place in the newly formed Conference South. In that season, Parker left the club by mutual consent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWelling playing Millwall in a pre-season friendly at Park View Road.\r\nFormer Coventry City and Republic of Ireland player Liam Daish took charge of the team on a caretaker basis before the permanent position was handed to former Norwich City and Gillingham defender Adrian Pennock, who narrowly missed out on taking the club into the promotion play-offs. Pennock left the club at the end of the 2006–07 season. His last game managing the Wings finished in a 1–1 draw at home to Hayes. Pennock joined Stoke City in a coaching position under his former Gillingham manager, Tony Pulis.\r\n\r\nOn 16 May 2007, Welling United appointed Neil Smith as the new first team manager. However, after only seven months in charge Smith parted company with the club on 7 January 2008. It was mutually agreed between the club and Smith that his reign as Wings boss would end.\r\n\r\nAndy Ford was appointed the new manager of the Wings on 31 January 2008. Despite losing 6–2 to Cambridge City in his first game in charge, Ford guided the Wings to safety and they eventually finished 16th. Welling finished 7th in the Conference South in 2008\/09 under the guidance of Ford. After a poor start to the 2009–10 season Ford resigned stating he didn't think he could achieve what he wanted on the current budget. Jamie Day was announced as the new player\/manager in November 2009.\r\n\r\nOn 12 August 2010, the club was served with a winding-up petition by HMRC, due for a hearing later that month. The Wings were given 14 weeks to pay the outstanding debt to the HMRC, and thanks almost entirely to the supporters were able to raise £60,000 to clear all monies owed. During this period, in a Football Conference Hearing on 16 September 2010, Welling United admitted to a misconduct charge in connection with the outstanding HMRC debt. Resultantly an immediate deduction of 5 points was enforced on the club together with a suspended £5,000 fine.\r\n\r\nDespite the Wings having a transfer embargo enforced upon them and also being deducted 5 points by the Football Conference, all within four weeks of the start of 2010–11 season, Jamie Day's side were competitively competing for the Conference South title. However, even though Welling United were in the top 5 for almost half of the season, a string of poor results in the final month of the campaign saw the Wings miss out on a play-off place by one point, with a final position of 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormer player manager Jamie Day with the Conference South trophy after winning the title in 2013\r\nThe 2011–12 season ended with Welling in 3rd place and after defeating Sutton United 2–1 on aggregate in the play-off semi-finals they narrowly missed promotion in the final, going down 0–1 to Dartford at Princes Park.\r\n\r\nWelling made a return to the top level of non-league football the following season after clinching the Conference South title, 13 years after they last played at the fifth tier of English football. Between 3 November and 5 February, Welling also broke the league's record for consecutive wins with 12 in a row.\r\n\r\nIn December 2014 Jamie Day left Welling by mutual consent. He was replaced by Jake Gallagher and Jamie Turner as caretakers, but on 21 December it was announced that Jody Brown of Grays Athletic would become manager. On 3 March 2015, Jody Brown was relieved of his duties after just one point in his first nine games.

It has been the home of Premier League club West Bromwich Albion F.C. since 1900, when it became the sixth ground to be used by the club. The ground was the last Football League ground to be built in the 19th century. At an altitude of 551 feet (168 m), it is the highest ground among those of all 92 Premier League and Football League clubs.\r\nThe expiry of the lease on Stoney Lane, as well as the club's desire for a more spacious location, saw them move once again in 1900, this time permanently. All of Albion's previous grounds had been close to the centre of West Bromwich, but on this occasion they took up an \"out of town\" site on the borders of Handsworth. The area was covered in hawthorn bushes, which were cleared to make way for the new ground, hence its name, the Hawthorns. The club signed a lease for the land on 14 May 1900, giving them the option to buy within 14 years from the owner, Sandwell Park Colliery, and Albion did indeed buy the freehold on the ground in June 1913.\r\n\r\nWhen opened, the Hawthorns could hold around 35,500 spectators. The first match took place on Monday 3 September 1900, when Albion drew 1–1 with Derby County in front of a crowd of 20,104. Derby's England international Steve Bloomer scored the first Hawthorns goal, with Chippy Simmons equalizing for Albion. The first Saturday game followed soon after, with Albion losing out 0–1 to fierce local rivals Aston Villa in front of a capacity crowd, officially put at 35,417 but with many more forcing entry and an estimated 15,000 people locked out. The 1900–01 campaign was not a successful one however, as Albion finished bottom of the table and were relegated to Division Two. Their defeat to Sheffield United on the final day of the season was witnessed by just 1,050 spectators, which remains the record lowest crowd for a league game at the Hawthorns.","strStadiumLocation":"West Bromwich, Sandwell, West Midlands","intStadiumCapacity":"26688","strWebsite":"www.wba.co.uk","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/westbromwichalbionofficial","strTwitter":"www.twitter.com\/wbafcofficial","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/wba","strDescriptionEN":"West Bromwich Albion Football Club \/ˈbrɒmɪtʃ\/, also known as West Brom, The Baggies, The Throstles, Albion or WBA, is an English professional football club based in West Bromwich in the West Midlands.

Holding 80,000 for the Olympics and the Paralympics, the stadium re-opened in July 2016 with a capacity of 60,000. The decision to make West Ham United the main tenants was controversial, with the initial tenancy process having to be rerun.\r\n\r\nThe stadium hosted several 2015 Rugby World Cup matches, two England rugby league Test matches, and the 2017 IAAF World Championships in Athletics and 2017 World Para Athletics Championships (the first time both events had been held in the same location in the same year).

They play in League One of the English Football League, the third tier in the English football league system since promotion in May 2016. They are based at Kingsmeadow, a ground which was shared with Isthmian League club Kingstonian F.C. until 2017, and is now shared with Chelsea Ladies.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded by Wimbledon F.C. supporters in June 2002 as a direct reaction to the decision by an independent commission appointed by the Football Association to allow Wimbledon F.C. to relocate to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, about 56 miles (90 km) north of Wimbledon. The large majority of Wimbledon F.C. supporters very strongly opposed the idea of moving the club so far away from Wimbledon, feeling that a club transplanted to Milton Keynes would no longer represent Wimbledon F.C.'s legacy and traditions, and, having campaigned against the proposed move, viewed its official sanctioning as the \"death of their club\". Wimbledon F.C. physically moved in 2003 and then changed the name of the club to Milton Keynes Dons in 2004. Although founded in similar circumstances to the 1961 Washington Senators to replace a club which continued its existence elsewhere, AFC Wimbledon has come to be considered a successor or \"phoenix\" version of the original team.\r\n\r\nWhen AFC Wimbledon was formed, it affiliated to both the London and Surrey Football Associations, and entered the Premier Division of the Combined Counties League, which is the ninth tier in English football. In its short history, the club has been extremely successful, being promoted six times in 13 seasons, and going up from the ninth tier (Combined Counties Premier) to the third (League One).

The club was originally known as St. Luke's FC and was founded in 1877 and since 1889 has played at Molineux. They currently compete in the Football League Championship, the second highest tier of English football, having been promoted from League One in 2014 after a solitary season at that level.\r\n\r\nHistorically, Wolves have been highly influential, most notably as being founder members of the Football League, as well as having played an instrumental role in the establishment of the European Cup, later to become the UEFA Champions League. Having won the FA Cup twice before the outbreak of the First World War, they developed into one of England's leading clubs under the management of ex-player Stan Cullis after the Second World War, going on to win the league three times and the FA Cup twice more between 1949 and 1960. It was during this time that the European Cup competition was established, after the English press declared Wolves \"Champions of the World\" following their victories against numerous top European and World sides in some of British football's first live televised games.\r\n\r\nWolves have yet to match the successes of the Stan Cullis era, although, under Bill McGarry, they contested the first-ever UEFA Cup final in 1972 and won the 1974 League Cup, a trophy they lifted again six years later under John Barnwell. However, financial mismanagement in the 1980s led to the club's very existence being under threat as well as three consecutive relegations, before a revival and back-to-back promotions under manager Graham Turner and record goalscorer Steve Bull saw them finish the decade in the Second Division, winning the Football League Trophy along the way.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/qwvuqy1448811552.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133599-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/wdes121532295945.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/p2xn8q1532295468.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/kzx8521532295383.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/3zzmow1532295430.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/co1ppu1532295499.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/vyxrss1462380950.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/officialwolvesvideo","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"136837","idSoccerXML":"4957","idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Wolves

A group of young furniture trade workers started a team to play matches in 1884. This team was called North Town Wanderers.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, a meeting held at the Steam Engine public house in Station Road, High Wycombe saw the formation of Wycombe Wanderers F.C. It is highly likely the club was named Wanderers after the famous Wanderers, winners of the first F.A. Cup in 1872. The club played friendly matches between 1887 and 1896. It first entered the F.A. Amateur Cup in 1894 and the F.A. Cup in 1895. In 1895 the club moved to Loakes Park, which would become its home for the next 95 years. In 1896 the club joined the Southern League and competed in the Second Division until 1908.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1908 the club declined the invitation to retain their membership of the Southern League. The club decided to pursue amateur instead of professional football and joined the Great Western Suburban League and remained there until the outbreak of the First World War. After the hostilities had ended the club joined the Spartan League in 1919 and were Champions in successive years. In March 1921 the club's application to join the Isthmian League was accepted.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"England","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/yytsqt1423805554.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-134382-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/37a52o1536843511.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/32q2ij1536832112.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/hbubj71536832159.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/behkpy1536832206.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/fq9kgh1536832237.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/0lz9lx1536832657.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCR_EcVkERzNZuRiEpmmsRng","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134300","idSoccerXML":"755","idAPIfootball":"1377","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Yeovil","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Yeovil Town","intFormedYear":"1895","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"English National League","idLeague":"4590","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Huish Park","strKeywords":"The Glovers, YTFC","strRSS":"http:\/\/www.ytfc.net\/common\/rss\/news-rss-feed.xml","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/19wu361526911858.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Huish Park is a football stadium located in Yeovil, Somerset.

With a capacity of 8,256, the ground is located near the centre of the city, just over a mile from York railway station.\r\n\r\nYork City leased land at Bootham Crescent from York Cricket Club as a replacement for their ground at Fulfordgate, which was on the outskirts of the city. The ground was constructed in four months, and officially opened on 31 August 1932. During the Second World War, the Popular Stand was converted into an air-raid shelter, and the ground suffered slight damage when a bomb landed on houses along the Shipton Street End. York purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075 in September 1948. Floodlights were fitted at the ground in 1959, and were replaced by ones twice as powerful in 1995. A number of improvements were made in the early 1980s, with a gymnasium, offices and a lounge for officials built.\r\n\r\nThe David Longhurst Stand opened in 1991 after a roof was erected on the Shipton Street End. It was named after the former York player David Longhurst, who died during a match at the ground in 1990. Bootham Crescent hosted football in the Football League from 1932 to 2004 and from 2012 to 2016, both spells ending after York were relegated into non-League football. The ground was renamed KitKat Crescent from 2005 to 2010 as part of a sponsorship deal with Nestlé. York are expected to move to a community stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington in early 2018, and the Bootham Crescent site will be used for housing.\r\n\r\nBootham Crescent comprises four stands: the Main Stand, the Popular Stand, the David Longhurst Stand and the Grosvenor Road End. The ground has held a league representative match, neutral club matches, and schoolboy and youth international matches. Other than football, it has hosted a concert, a grand firework display, American football and rugby league matches and beer festivals. The record attendance of 28,123 was set in March 1938, for an FA Cup match against Huddersfield Town. The highest seasonal average attendance of 10,412 was achieved in 1948–49.","strStadiumLocation":"York, North Yorkshire, England","intStadiumCapacity":"8256","strWebsite":"www.yorkcityfootballclub.co.uk","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"York City Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city of York, North Yorkshire, England.

A new club was formed in 1922, and played in the Midland League for seven years before joining the Football League. They played in the third tier until 1959, when they were promoted for the first time. York achieved their best run in the FA Cup in 1954–55, when they met Newcastle United in the semi-final. They fluctuated between the Third and Fourth Divisions, before spending two seasons in the Second Division in the 1970s. York first played at Wembley Stadium in 1993, when they won the Third Division play-off final. At the end of 2003–04, they lost their Football League status after being relegated from the Third Division. The 2011–12 FA Trophy was the first national knockout competition won by York, and they returned to the Football League that season.\r\n\r\nYork are nicknamed \"the Minstermen\", after York Minster, and the team traditionally play in red kits. They played at Fulfordgate from 1922 to 1932, when they moved to their current ground, Bootham Crescent. The ground has been subject to numerous improvements over the years, but the club lost ownership of it when it was transferred to a holding company in 1999.
