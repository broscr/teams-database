In that year (1947) they won the Second division title reaching the First division for the first time.

The fans of Braga are known as Arsenalistas due to their team home kit that resembles that of English club Arsenal.

This match is more than football, it is a way people from the north view each city. The derby is one of Portugal's most intense matches, and children under 13 are restricted from entering unless an adult is with them. The rivalry goes back to when the City of Braga was the ancient capital of Gallaecia and the largest Portuguese city by the time the Kingdom of Portugal was formed by Afonso I of Portugal.

The club plays its home matches at the Estádio Marcolino de Castro, with a capacity of 5,500 spectators. It currently plays in the LigaPro, Portugal's second-tier division of professional football.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the first initiatives of its founders, Luís Amorim, Artur Bastos, Luís Cadilon and Arthur Lee, was to acquire land to build the first playground in the woods at Picalhos near the railway Valley Vouga. In 1924, they leased land and started embankments and soon the first few games took place against the Lourosa on 4 May 1924 in which the Feirense won 2–1. The first president was Santa Maria da Feiria native Alcides Machado da Silva, who took office on 30 December 1924.\r\n\r\nIn 1926 and ever since, the club has kept the Feirense, created a committee with the aim of acquiring a new site with better conditions for a new field, having managed in the Place of Montinho, closer to the center of the Town of Fair, belonging to Mr. Simon Adriano. Curiously, this time Feirense were fitted with a red and black sweater with vertical stripes. On 2 March 1931, the field of Montinho was opened with a selection match between Porto and Aveiro, and that year the team was equipped with a blue shirt, black shorts and black socks.\r\n\r\nIn the 1931–32 season, Feirense first participated in a tournament, debuting in the championship of the promotion of Aveiro, the lower division of the district, being defeated 2–1 in the first official game in the field of Cortegaça. Since the late 1930s and until 1950, Feirense went through various difficulties and the main note of relief was the creation of the first emblem of C.D. Feirense designed by António da Costa. Feirense continued its participation in the championship district of Aveiro and on 15 January 1955, Marcolino Castro was elected for the first time as president of Feirense (he would go on to later be elected five more times and lead over a total of nine seasons) and the team began to primarily wear blue shirts and white shorts. The next year, for the first time the team participated in the national championship of the 3rd Division, with the first game played in Avintes. In March 1956, the club's youth department was founded, as well as the creation of a team of juniors.\r\n\r\nIn 1958, the first statutes of the club were approved, the flag's colors and design for the new badge were authored by Dr. Humberto de Paiva. In the 1959–60 season, Feirense won the first district championship of Aveiro and at the same time played the 3rd Division, managing to also climb to the 2nd Division. Feirense repeated the title of district champion of Aveiro in the 1965–66 and 1967–68 seasons. In 1960–61, they first participated in the National League division 2.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1960s, Feirense had one of the best periods in its history, achieving victory in the northern part of the 2nd Division, inauguration of the current stadium and Marcolino Castro premiere at the 1st National Division in 1962–63. In 1968–69, Feirense won its first title of the Aveiro district youth in the juvenile level. In 1969, Arthur Eng Brandão, patron of the training school, was elected for the first time chairman of the board, which happened four more times and a total of nine seasons.\r\n\r\nArthur and Marcolino Brandão de Castro were the presidents who had the longest terms leading the club. In 1975–76, the club's youth were in evidence with the presence of the youth team in the final of the National 2nd division held in Tomar. In 1976–77, Feirense won the central area of the 2nd division next season and raced for the 2nd time the national championship in Division 1. In 1982–83, the youth team of juvenile Feirense after winning the same district title, disputed the semi-finals of the National Youth Cup. On 22 September 1987 Feirense for the first time had a field of natural grass turf with the inauguration of the stadium Marcolino Castro. In 1988–89, the Feirense winner was again the center region of the 2nd division next season and race for the 3rd time the national championship in Division 1. In 1990, Fernando Carvalho da Feirense's cycling team won the 52nd back to Portugal in cycling.\r\n\r\nIn 1990–91 the Feirense was matched in the semi-finals of the Cup of Portugal with Porto.
