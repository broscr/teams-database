The tribunes form a continuous ring which are quite low behind each goal but rise up on each side. Unlike Rajamangala though, Thammasat has a roof covering both side tribunes. Most striking about this stadium are the floodlights. Thai architects usually favour concrete pylons but these are the steel variety. As viewed from the exterior of the stadium the base of each pylon seems to grip the outside of the stadium and they dramatically lean over the tribunes so as to better illuminate the playing area.\r\n\r\nThammasat was going to be used for PEA FC's match against Singapore Armed Forces FC in an Asian Champions League qualifier in February 2009, but the pitch was deemed unplayable and the match was switched to Rajamangala.","strStadiumLocation":"Pathum Thani, Thailand","intStadiumCapacity":"25000","strWebsite":"truebangkokunitedfc.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/truebangkokunited\/","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/TRUEBUFC","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/true_bangkok_united","strDescriptionEN":"Bangkok United Football Club (Thai: สโมสรฟุตบอล แบงค็อก ยูไนเต็ด) is a Thai professional football club based in Pathum Thani Province.
