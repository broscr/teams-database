The club was formed in 1923, refounded in 1993 after going bankrupt and refounded in 2010 after being unable to enroll in the tournament. The club currently plays in Serie C, the third tier of Italian football.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded on 9 September 1923, by a group of friends, and football fans, as Juventus Football Club Arezzo (in honour of Juventus F.C.). In 1930, following a merge with several other minor Arezzo teams, the club became Unione Sportiva Arezzo, which was admitted in 1935 to new-born Serie C division. The team was relegated from Serie C in 1953, following several financial troubles, returning to Serie C division five years later. In 1961, Arezzo started to play its games in the Stadio Comunale, its current venue. In 1966, Arezzo promoted to Serie B for the first time; in order to celebrate the triumph, Arezzo played a friendly match with Brazilian team Vasco da Gama, winning it 2–1. However, the next year Arezzo was not able to remain in the division, and returned to Serie C the following year. But in 1969 Arezzo again won Serie C, and returned to play in Serie B, where it played until 1975. In 1971, Arezzo signed striker Francesco Graziani, who quickly became a fan favourite and a key player for the team.\r\n\r\nThe third promotion to Serie B came in 1982, under coach Antonio Valentin Angelillo, with Tullio Gritti as striker. The previous year, Arezzo had won its first (and only) Italy's Serie C Cup, defeating Ternana in the finals. In 1984, Arezzo barely missed promotion to Serie A, ending just five points back from the last promotion place. In 1988, despite a team accordingly built to promote to Serie A, Arezzo relegated to Serie C1. Arezzo disbanded in 1993, following financial troubles, being excluded by Serie C1 seven football days before the end of the season. Following the cancellation, a pool of shareholders led by former Arezzo star Ciccio Graziani founded Associazione Calcio Arezzo, admitted to Serie D. In 1996 an unknown coach with a few lower division experiences, Serse Cosmi, was appointed as new manager. Despite his complete lack of experience in the division, Cosmi immediately won hands down Serie D, leading Arezzo back to professional football. In 1998, again with Cosmi, Arezzo qualified to and won the Serie C2 promotion playoffs, gaining promotion to Serie C1. In 1999\/2000, despite the contributions of Fabio Bazzani, Arezzo lost promotion playoffs; the following year, after Cosmi left Arezzo for Serie A side Perugia, Antonio Cabrini was appointed as new coach, and Mario Frick replaced Bazzani as forward. The team returned to Serie B in 2004, with Mario Somma as coach; the next season, which saw Pasquale Marino replacing Somma, who signed for Empoli, Arezzo barely maintained a Serie B place.\r\n\r\n\r\n1973–74 Arezzo\r\nAt the end of the 2009-10 Lega Pro Prima Divisione season the club, due to financial problems, were unable to enroll to the next season tournament. A new club with the Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Atletico Arezzo denomination was entered in Serie D.\r\n\r\nIn November 2010 the club was acquired by a consortium of Rome-based entrepreneurs (including popular actor Luca Zingaretti) for a sum of €400,000; the new owners immediately made a number of changes, appointing former Cagliari player Maurizio Coppola as head coach and former Serie A star Abel Balbo as assistant coach and technical area coordinator.\r\n\r\nOn 1 July 2012 the club was renamed Unione Sportiva Arezzo with Balbo as new head coach, replaced since 30 October 2012 by Michele Bacis.\r\n\r\nOn 9 January 2013 Mauro Ferretti, an enreprenuer from Rome, bought the club. A few weeks later, on 28 January, Federico Nofri replaced Bacis as coach.\r\n\r\nFor the 2013–14 season, Davide Mezzanotti was appointed as new coach. After the club ended in third place, Ezio Capuano was named new head coach; later on September 2014, Arezzo was readmitted to Lega Pro to fill a vacancy. Under Capuano's tenure (which lasted until April 2016), the club safely escaped relegation on both seasons. For the 2016–17 season, the club came with a new head coach, Stefano Sottili, and a number of major signings such as former Serie A player Davide Moscardelli.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":"L'Unione Sportiva Arezzo è una società calcistica italiana con sede nella città di Arezzo, rifondata il 2 agosto 2010[2].

In this version of the stadium, the highest ever attendance was recorded when on the 10th of February 1974, 35,991 people watched Cesena defeat giants AC Milan. The stadium was called La Fiorita from its construction until 1982, when it became named after former Cesena president Dino Manuzzi.\r\n\r\nIn 1988 the stadium underwent a complete restructuring were all of the existing stands were demolished and then rebuilt. The new capacity was reduced to 23,860.\r\n\r\nAs a part of Italy's Euro 2016 bid, the Dino Manuzzi was included and there were plans to invest close to €30m on the stadium. The planned changes included an increase in capacity to over 31,000 new press boxes, VIP lounges and media boxes. This fell through after Euro 2016 was awarded to France.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 2011\/12 season, the pitch was converted to an artificial playing surface, with Cesena becoming the first club to do so. On the 13th of August, 2011, at the end of the Italy - Japan rugby match, fans were allowed to enter the pitch and take a cut out of grass with them. That same summer some further work was carried out on the stadium, including a capacity expansion by 1,000 seats. New chairs were installed. The chairs were a white and black colour and on one terrace they spell out AC Cesena.

Cittadella won its first promotion to Serie B in 1999 after defeating Brescello in the playoff finals, and spent a total two seasons in the Italian second-highest ranked division, being then relegated in 2001–02 Serie B. During their first stay in Serie B, the club played in Stadio Euganeo in Padua and, in an attempt to expand the fanbase, was renamed A.S. Cittadella Padova, being Padua (Padova in Italian) the capital city of Cittadella's referring province.\r\n\r\nCittadella returned to Serie B in 2008, after defeating Cremonese in the 2007–08 Serie C1\/A playoffs, under the guide of head coach Claudio Foscarini. In the 2008–09 Serie B season, the club was involved to projects focused to boost the capacity of the Stadio Tombolato to 7,500, in order to let the club play in their home town (with dispensation from the FIGC, since a stadium of at least 10,000 seats is required for Serie B). Thus, Cittadella played the first season games in Stadio Omobono Tenni in Treviso, about 40 km away. After some delays, the first Serie B game played in Cittadella was played on 29 October 2008, Ancona being the opponents.

In 1978, following the Italian football league reorganisation, Crotone was relegated to Serie C2 and the following year was declared bankrupt. A new club, Associazione Sportiva Crotone, began competing again in the Prima Categoria (eighth division).\r\n\r\nCrotone was promoted to Serie C2 in 1984–85, but only for one season. The team's name was changed to Kroton Calcio, and the club was promoted again to C2 after the 1986–87 season, where it played until 1991. A second bankruptcy led to the foundation of Football Club Crotone Calcio with Raffaele Vrenna as chairman, starting in the Promozione (7th level). Crotone gained successive promotions to Serie C2 and C1, winning in the play-offs against Locri and Benevento, respectively.\r\n\r\nUnder Antonello Cuccureddu, Crotone first reached Serie B in 2000, returning to the second level two seasons later. Again in division two in 2004, after disposing of Viterbese in the promotion play-offs, it remained in the category until the 2006–07 season.\r\n\r\nAfter being beaten by Taranto in the 2008 play-offs, Crotone returned to the second division the following season, defeating Benevento.\r\n\r\nThe team was promoted to the Italian top flight (Serie A), for the 2016–17 season for the first time in its history. They finished in 17th, securing a place in the next Serie A season, by beating Lazio 3–1 on the last matchday, knocking down Empoli as they lost their match against Palermo.

Nel 2010 è diventata la prima e unica squadra italiana ad aver conquistato le tre competizioni principali disputate nel corso della stagione: la Champions League, il campionato e la Coppa Italia; coi successivi trionfi in Supercoppa italiana e Coppa del mondo per club FIFA è diventata anche la prima, e, finora, unica squadra del Paese a vincere cinque trofei nell'arco di un anno solare.\r\n\r\nIl club può contare su un sostegno numeroso sia a livello nazionale che internazionale.

Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city, the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium. Nicknamed Vecchia Signora (\"the Old Lady\"), the club has won 35 official league titles, 13 Coppa Italia titles and eight Supercoppa Italiana titles, being the record holder for all these competitions; two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cups \/ UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, a joint national record of three UEFA Cups, two UEFA Super Cups and a joint national record of one UEFA Intertoto Cup. Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) ranking whilst on the international stage occupies the 5th position in Europe and the eleventh in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies, having led the UEFA ranking during seven seasons since its inception in 1979, the most for an Italian team and joint second overall.\r\n\r\nFounded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club, it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed uninterruptedly in the top flight league (reformulated as Serie A from 1929) since its debut in 1900 after changing its name to Foot-Ball Club Juventus, with the exception of the 2006–07 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923. The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus the first professional sporting club ante litteram in the country, having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s and becoming one of the first ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s, being listed on the Borsa italiana since 2001.\r\n\r\nUnder the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international titles, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976–77 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983–84 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984–85 European Champions' Cup. With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all confederation trophies; an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi, becoming in addition the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association. In December 2000, Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th Century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.\r\n\r\nThe club's fan base is the largest at national level and one of the largest worldwide. Unlike most European sporting supporters' groups, which are often concentrated around their own club's city of origin, it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of anticampanilismo (\"anti-parochialism\") and italianità (\"Italianness\"). Juventus players have won eight Ballon d'Or awards, four of these in consecutive years (1982–1985, an overall record), among these the first player representing Serie A, Omar Sívori, as well as Michel Platini and three of the five recipients with Italian nationality as the former member of the youth sector Paolo Rossi; they have also won four FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners as Roberto Baggio and Zinédine Zidane, a national record and third and joint second highest overall, respectively, in the cited prizes. Additionally, players representing the club have won 11 Serie A Footballer of the Year awards including the only goalkeeper to win it, Gianluigi Buffon, and 17 different players were inducted in the Serie A Team of the Year, being both also a record. Finally, the club has also provided the most players to the Italy national team—mostly in official competitions in almost uninterrupted way since 1924—who often formed the group that led the Azzurri squad to international success, most importantly in the 1934, 1982 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Italy","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/dd6d6q1535186317.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133676-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/b3cfr71535186225.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wwtuxx1420504589.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/vqh3kj1548875099.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/rqwwqx1424111979.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wvvpws1430771058.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/upuwxp1422399935.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/juventus","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"137120","idSoccerXML":"4976","idAPIfootball":"1715","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Juventus U23","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1929","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Italian Serie C","idLeague":"4398","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Stadio Giuseppe Moccagatta","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"Stadio Giuseppe Moccagatta is a multi-use stadium in Alessandria, Italy.

The society, founded in 1900, plays in the Serie A and have spent most of their history in the top tier of Italian football. Lazio have been Italian champions twice (1974, 2000), and have won the Coppa Italia seven times, the Supercoppa Italiana five times, and both the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Super Cup on one occasion.\r\n\r\nThe club had their first major success in 1958, winning the domestic cup. In 1974, they won their first Serie A title. The 1990s have been the most successful period in Lazio's history, seeing them win the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 1999, the Serie A title in 2000, and reaching their first UEFA Cup final in 1998. Due to a severe economic crisis in 2002 that forced president Sergio Cragnotti out of the club along with several star players being sold, Lazio's success in the league declined. In spite of the lower funds, the club has won four Coppa Italia titles since then; in 2004, 2009, 2013 and 2019. Current president Claudio Lotito took charge of the club in 2004 after two years of a vacuum after Cragnotti's departure.\r\n\r\nLazio's traditional kit colours are sky blue shirts and white shorts with white socks; the colours are reminiscent of Rome's ancient Hellenic legacy. Sky blue socks have also been interchangeably used as home colours. Their home is the 70,634 capacity Stadio Olimpico in Rome, which they share with A.S. Roma until 2020, when the latter will leave for the Stadio della Roma. Lazio have a long-standing rivalry with Roma, with whom they have contested the Derby della Capitale (in English \"Derby of the capital city\" or Rome derby) since 1929.\r\n\r\nDespite initially not having any parent–subsidiary relation with the male and female professional team (that was incorporated as S.S. Lazio S.p.A.), the founding of Società Sportiva Lazio allowed for the club that participates in over 40 sports disciplines in total, more than any other sports association in the world.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Italy","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/rwqyvs1448806608.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133668-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/loprki1535387399.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qryrrs1429294544.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/piypy91535387252.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/uruyvw1429294563.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qywsqq1421077269.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/wsyqry1422399753.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/Officialsslazio","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133678","idSoccerXML":"89","idAPIfootball":"867","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Lecce","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"US Lecce, Apulia, Giallorossi","intFormedYear":"1908","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Italian Serie A","idLeague":"4332","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Stadio Via del Mare","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"The Stadio Ettore Giardiniero - Via del Mare is a multi-purpose stadium in Lecce, Italy.

Founded in 2015 as S.S.D. Monza 1912, it is the successor to the club founded on 1 September 1912 as Monza Foot Ball Club. The team went through various refoundations and mergers, the last of which being Associazione Calcio Monza Brianza 1912, declared bankrupt and expelled from professional football at the end of the 2014–15 season.\r\n\r\nMonza is among the Italian teams with the most number of appearances in Serie B, taking part in 38 editions, with the last time being during the 2000–01 season. In its history, the club has never reached the Serie A, making it the team that has participated in the most Italian second division seasons without ever achieving promotion to the first division. Monza holds the record of victories in the Coppa Italia Serie C, winning it four times. They also won six Serie C championships, an Anglo-Italian Cup and a Coppa delle Alpi.\r\n\r\nKnown as i Bagai (\"the Boys\"), Monza's kit colours have traditionally been red and white. They have played at the Stadio Brianteo since 1988.\r\n\r\nThe club's history began in 1912, when the fusion of various city societies gave life to Monza Foot Ball Club. Starting from the Terza Categoria, the club climbed the divisional ladders Italian football during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1939, although still playing in Terza Divisione, the club reached the Coppa Italia quarter-finals (the only team of this level to be able to achieve the same result was Bari in 1984, to then be overcome in 2016 by Alessandria who reached the semifinals). In 1951 Monza gained promotion to the Serie B and stayed in the division for fifteen years, before going back to Serie C. Returning immediately to the second division, Monza opened its first success cycle in the mid-seventies, when it was noted for its performance in the Coppa Italia Serie C: they played three consecutive finals, winning the first two over Lecce and Sorrento, but losing in 1976 in a second confrontation with the Apulians. At the end of the season, the team won the Anglo-Italian Cup in the final against Wimbledon FC. At the end of the seventies the Lombard club came close to gaining promotion to the Serie A, but lost the chance two matches from the end of the season.\r\n\r\nBetween the eighties and nineties, Monza saw an era of success between the second and third division: in 1988 and 1991 they won the Coppa Italia Serie C, both times against Palermo. In 1996, the club lost in the Coppa Italia Serie C final against Empoli. At the beginning of the 2000s, the club returned to Serie C1 again and in the mid-2000s, after losing the Coppa Italia Serie C final against Salernitana, Monza entered administration and started again from Serie D. In 2017 the club won the Serie D and returned to the Serie C, before losing their fourth Coppa Italia Serie C final in 2019, against Viterbese.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Italy","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/awamjy1579725045.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/wsuvtq1423846954.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133670","idSoccerXML":"78","idAPIfootball":"492","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Napoli","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"S.S.C.

The present capacity of the San Paolo is 60,240.\r\n\r\nThe stadium is probably most famous for hosting the 1990 World Cup semi-final between Italy and Argentina. Considered to be the most intriguing match of that World Cup, Diego Maradona asked for the Napoli fans to cheer for Argentina. The Napoli tifosi responded by hanging a flag in their \"curva\" of the stadium saying \"Maradona, Naples loves you, but Italy is our homeland\". It was touching for Maradona as Napoli was the only stadium during that World Cup that the Argentinian national anthem was not jeered. The match finished 1–1 after extra time.

The club have won two league titles, five Coppa Italias, two Supercoppa Italiana titles, and one UEFA Cup.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1926, the club saw relatively little success in its early years, winning one Coppa Italia until 1965, where they were refounded. Napoli then saw increased success in the 1980s, after the club acquired Diego Maradona. During his time in Naples, Maradona helped the team win several trophies, which led to the club retiring his number 10 jersey. During this period, Napoli won their sole league titles, in 1987 and 1990. Following his departure, however, Napoli struggled financially, and endured several relegations, prior to being refounded in 2004 by film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis. Under his guise, the club has stabilized, which has led to renewed on-field success, winning the 2012 and 2014 Coppa Italia titles.\r\n\r\nBy attendance, Napoli have the fourth biggest fanbase in Italy, and were ranked as the fifth highest-earning football club in Serie A, with $182 million in revenue during the 2017–18 season. In 2018, Forbes estimated the club is the fifth most valuable club in Italy, worth $379 million.

(Football Association Studenti) was created by eight students of Liceo Carlo Alberto, aged between 15–16 years; among them an engineer, Gianni Canestrini, and a lawyer, Piero Zorini. In Novara in those days, there were other small clubs like Voluntas, Pro Scalon, Ginnastica e Scherma, Forza & Speranza, Collegio Gallarini and many other student bodies. The best players from these teams came together to form Novara Calcio, and made their debut in the Italian league on 3 November 1912.\r\n\r\nThe first match was played against a team already then established as Torino, who won 2–1, with the first Novara goal scored by Mario Menendez.\r\n\r\nIn the years between World War I and World War II, Novara merged with Pro Vercelli, Alessandria and Casale to make the so-called \"quadrilatero piemontese\" (Piedmont Quadrilateral). Novara's highest finish came in 1952 when they finished in eighth place in Serie A.\r\n\r\nDuring these years of staying in the top flight, Novara had Silvio Piola to thank. His many goals (which at the end of his career was over 300), made a huge contribution to the cause of Novara. Following his death in 1996, the stadium at which Novara play was dedicated in his name.\r\n\r\nIn 1956 came relegation to Serie B, and another five years afterwards, they slipped down to Serie C due to a fraudulent complaint by a Sambenedettese player.\r\n\r\nA few successful seasons in Serie B followed, but then Novara stumbled again in 1977 with relegation to Serie C and worse in 1981 to Serie C2. In the 1995–96 season, Novara were back in Serie C1, but this joy was short-lived as the following year, the biancoazzurri again had to deal with relegation.\r\n\r\nYears were spent in the shadows of Italian football until more recently when the league was won in the 2002–03 season.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Italy","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/xsxxux1429975444.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/wstwsu1423850265.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"135735","idSoccerXML":"4751","idAPIfootball":"1697","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Olbia","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1905","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Italian Serie C","idLeague":"4398","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Stadio Bruno Nespoli","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"","strStadiumLocation":"Olbia, Sardinia, Italy","intStadiumCapacity":"8000","strWebsite":"www.olbiacalcio.com","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Olbia Calcio 1905 S.r.l.

It is currently home of U.S. Città di Palermo football team. The stadium was inaugurated on January 24, 1932 and was named Stadio Littorio in homage to the Fascism. The opening match was Palermo vs Atalanta, with Palermo winning 5–1. A track surrounded the pitch and there were no stands behind either goal. In 1936, the stadium was renamed Stadio Michele Marrone, in memory of a soldier killed during the Spanish Civil War. The name was changed again at the end of World War II to Stadio La Favorita, from the name of the nearby ancient game preserve of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor in the 13th century.\r\n\r\nIn 1948, the track was removed and stands behind each goal were built. In 1984, the second main redevelopment took place, involving the addition of a second tier to the stadium which increased capacity to 50,000 spectators. This higher capacity was however completely covered in only twice, respectively in a Serie C1 league match against Messina and a friendly match against Juventus. A third redevelopment ended in 1990, the last main one to which the venue was subjected and was undertaken due to city of Palermo having been chosen to host a number of the 1990 FIFA World Cup First Round matches. Due to this redevelopment, the capacity of the stadium was lowered to its current 37,619 seats.\r\n\r\nOn September 18, 2002 the stadium was renamed as Renzo Barbera, past chairman of Palermo in the club's last Serie A tenure, as well as the two Coppa Italia finals throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, who had died that same year on May 19. In the Serie A 2004-05 campaign, which marked the first Palermo appearance in the top division in over 30 years, all seats in the stadium were already assigned in the summer to season-ticket holders. However, this was not repeated in the next years.\r\n\r\nPlans were recently announced by current Palermo chairman Maurizio Zamparini in order to build a new stadium to be owned directly by the club.","strStadiumLocation":"Palermo, Italy","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Dissolved 2019\r\n\r\nPhoenix club - S.D.D.

Pescara has competed in six seasons in Serie A, 1977–78, 1979–80, 1987–88, 1988–89, 1992–93, 2012–13 and last participated in 2016–17. The team's official colors are white and light blue.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nAside from a spell in Serie B in the 1940s, Pescara had a relatively undistinguished history until promotion to Serie B in 1974. With players like Giorgio Repetto and Bruno Nobili in the midfield, they managed to win their first promotion to Serie A in 1977 after winning the promotion play-off, but ultimately finished their first season in Serie A in last place. A second promotion after a play-off followed, but once more they would be relegated from the top flight and then descended to Serie C1 within two years.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, after returning to Serie B after a year, Pescara would enjoy a revival after the appointment of Giovanni Galeone as coach in 1986. His philosophy of attacking football saw the Biancazzurri promoted to Serie A as champions in 1987, where they lasted two years with players such as Júnior and Blaž Slišković among the club's star players. Galeone would return during the 1990–91 season and oversaw another promotion the following year.\r\n\r\nAfter relegation, Pescara remained in Serie B side throughout the 1990s, narrowly missing promotion in 1999. Relegation to C1 followed in 2001, with promotion in 2003 being followed by two revoked relegations in a row due to bankruptcy and scandals affecting other clubs. Pescara was ultimately relegated in the 2006–07 season, with three presidential and managerial changes during the season. In December 2008, the debt-ridden club was legally declared out of business and its control passed to a bankruptcy trustee appointed by the Court of Pescara. In February 2009, a takeover from a group named Delfino Pescara 1936 was finalized with Deborah Caldora becoming the first woman to serve as chairman of the club. In the meantime, results did not improve significantly and in March, Giuseppe Galderisi was dismissed from the head coaching post with Antonello Cuccureddu being appointed as the new boss.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 2009–10 season, Eusebio Di Francesco was appointed as the new coach. Pescara finished second in Girone B of Lega Pro Prima Divisione and qualified for the promotional play-offs. They defeated Reggiana in the semi-final and Verona in the final and subsequently returned to Serie B after a three-year absence. The following season started with the appointment of Zdeněk Zeman as new head coach; the Czech manager immediately brought Pescara back into national coverage thanks to his well-known all-attacking playing style that turned out to match perfectly with promising youngsters such as Marco Verratti, Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne, who guided the squad to promotion to Serie A. Pescara secured promotion to the top-level after a 19-year absence after defeating Sampdoria with a 3–1 score in an away match on 20 May 2012. In the last minute of the final game of the regular season, Pescara striker Riccardo Maniero netted the winner in a match against Nocerina to claim Pescara's second Serie B title after Torino's draw away to AlbinoLeffe.\r\n\r\nPescara began the 2012–13 campaign looking for a new manager after Zdeněk Zeman left the club to manage Roma. Pescara started their new season in Serie A with a 3–0 loss to Internazionale and would not earn their first win until the fifth game of the season, a 1–0 win over Palermo. Pescara's stint in the top flight lasted just one season, as the club ended the season bottom of the table with a record of six wins, four draws and 28 loses, also recording the fewest clean sheets in the league, with five. That season, winger and leading-scorer Vladimír Weiss was also noted for picking up two red cards.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Italy","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/uywyxr1426869739.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/qvwtpq1474197903.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133819","idSoccerXML":"235","idAPIfootball":"872","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Piacenza","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1919","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Italian Serie C","idLeague":"4398","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Stadio Leonardo Garilli","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"The Stadio Leonardo Garilli is a multi-use stadium in Piacenza, Italy.

Currently it plays in Serie C, the third tier of Italian football.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nFounded in 1912, Pontedera, a team from a city in the Pisa neighbourhood, played Serie C for several years without never gaining a single promotion to Serie B. In 1993\/1994, a second place in Serie C2\/B allowed Pontedera to be promoted to Serie C1: during that season, the team was known for having longily been the only undefeated team in all Italian professional leagues, and for having incredibly won 2–1 to the Italy national football team coached by Arrigo Sacchi in a friendly match played in April 1994. Pontedera played Serie C1 just in 1994\/1995, and relegated to Serie D in 2001, and even Eccellenza in 2002. Pontedera returned to Serie D in 2005, after having won its Eccellenza round.\r\n\r\nIn summer 2006, The Gunther Corporation purchased Pontedera. It was reported in The Guardian newspaper on 17 May 2007 that the owner of Pontedera is a dog named Gunther IV, who inherited it from Gunther III who in turn inherited it from his owner Countess Libenstein.\r\n\r\nMarcello Lippi, head coach of Italy national team and World Cup champion in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, started his professional managing career as Pontedera head coach in 1985–1986.\r\n\r\nSerie D 2010–11\r\nAt the end of the 2010-11 Serie D season, Pontedera gained access to the Serie D play-off for promotion in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, but they were eliminated in the third round.\r\n\r\nBack into professionalism\r\nIn the 2012-13 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione season, Pontedera finished second in Girone B, and was promoted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione.

Mostly renowned as one of the most successful teams in the early football era of Italy, with seven national titles (all won between 1908 and 1922), they currently play in the Serie C league.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nEarly league successes and decline\r\nMain article: History of F.C. Pro Vercelli 1892\r\nThe origins of football in Vercelli go back to 1892 when it was founded as Società Ginnastica Pro Vercelli (Pro Vercelli Gymnastics Society), and 1903 with its Football Division.\r\n\r\nThe first official match for the football division of S.G. Pro Vercelli took place on 3 August 1903 against the Forza e Costanza.\r\n\r\nThe club won seven Italian Football Championships from 1908 to 1922: 1908, 1909, 1910–11, 1911–12, 1912–13, 1920–21, and 1921–22.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of professionalism in Italian football, and the rise of teams from larger industrial and business cities such as Milan and Turin, led Pro Vercelli to a slow but continuous decline. They played Serie A for their last time to date in 1934–35, and went ultimately relegated also from the 1947–48 Serie B, starting a long period out of the two top divisions of Italian football, even being relegated to Italy's amateur league, Serie D, in multiple times. They regained professional status for good after winning promotion and the Scudetto Dilettanti in the season 1993–94.\r\n\r\nBankruptcy and the new Pro Vercelli\r\n\r\nFormer Pro Belvedere logo\r\nIn the early 2000s, Pro Vercelli also had to challenge crosstown rivalry from a new team, A.S. Pro Belvedere Vercelli (with the colors yellow and green), founded in the summer of 2006 as a merger between A.S. Trino Calcio (based in Trino, Piedmont), who played in Serie D and minor league team P.G.S. Pro Belvedere, founded in 1912.\r\n\r\nIn the 2006–07 Serie D, the team finished 9th in Girone A. A year later, in the Serie D 2007–08 season, the team finished 3rd in the same division, qualifying for the Serie D play-offs. It won its way to the group stage of the tournament, but failed qualify as one of the top 5 teams of the play-offs, all of which were later promoted to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.\r\n\r\nIn the 2008–09 Serie D, Pro Belvedere finished first in Girone B, winning direct promotion to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. Their debut season into professional football also featured, for the first time in the club's history, a crosstown derby with Pro Vercelli, but was not particularly successful, with the team lying in second-last place for most of the time in the 2009–10 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, and promotion winning coach Luca Prina being replaced by the more experienced Gianfranco Motta.\r\n\r\nPro Belvedere were relegated after only one season but re-admitted to fill a number of vacancies in the league; at the same time, due to large debts, Pro Vercelli was not allowed to participate in the 2010–11 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione and so folded. In order to keep the old Pro Vercelli alive, Pro Belvedere changed its name to U.S. Vercelli Calcio and weeks later acquired honours and trademarks from the old Pro Vercelli, being thus allowed to switch its denomination to the current one, as well as to maintain the historical names and colors of the original team.\r\n\r\nIn the season 2010–11 the team played in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione ranking 3rd and was eliminated from Pro Patria in the semifinal of the play-off, but on 4 August 2011 it was later admitted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione to fill vacancies.\r\n\r\nNew successes: back to Serie B after 64 years\r\nIn the season 2011–12 of Lega Pro Prima Divisione the club was promoted to Serie B after 64 years, beating Carpi 3–1 in the final return of the play-off after the 0–0 of the first round.\r\n\r\nThe club had a very unsuccessful return to Serie B, finishing 21st of 22 teams and with a goal difference −30, the worst in the league. Their placing in the league meant that they were relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione.\r\n\r\nIn 2013–14 season, Girone A of Lega Pro 1, Pro Vercelli missed out on an immediate automatic promotion back to Serie B by a single point, finishing second in the league to Virtus Entella and eight points above third placed Südtirol. Striker Ettore Marchi starred throughout the season, scoring 15 goals. In the promotion play-offs, Pro Vercelli eliminated FeralpiSalò, Savona and ultimately defeated Südtirol in the final, thus returning to Serie B after only one season away.

The opening match was Palermo vs Atalanta, with Palermo winning 5–1. A track surrounded the pitch and there were no stands behind either goal. In 1936, the stadium was renamed Stadio Michele Marrone, in memory of a soldier killed during the Spanish Civil War. The name was changed again at the end of World War II to Stadio La Favorita, from the name of the nearby ancient game preserve of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor in the 13th century.\r\n\r\nIn 1948, the track was removed and stands behind each goal were built. In 1984, the second main redevelopment took place, involving the addition of a second tier to the stadium which increased capacity to 50,000 spectators. This higher capacity was, however, completely covered in only twice, respectively in a Serie C1 league match against Messina and a friendly match against Juventus. A third redevelopment ended in 1990, the last main one to which the venue was subjected and was undertaken due to city of Palermo having been chosen to host a number of the 1990 FIFA World Cup First Round matches. Due to this redevelopment, the capacity of the stadium was lowered to its current 37,619 seats.\r\n\r\nOn 18 September 2002, the stadium was renamed as Renzo Barbera, past chairman of Palermo in the club's last Serie A tenure, as well as the two Coppa Italia finals throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, who had died that same year on 19 May. In the Serie A 2004-05 campaign, which marked the first Palermo appearance in the top division in over 30 years, all seats in the stadium were already assigned in the summer to season-ticket holders.
