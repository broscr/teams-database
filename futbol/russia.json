Located in Sochi Olympic Park and named after Mount Fisht, the 40,000-capacity stadium was constructed for the 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, where it served as the venue for their opening and closing ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was originally built as an enclosed facility; it was re-opened in 2016 as an open-air football stadium, to host matches as part of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup when it was known simply as Fisht Stadium.\r\n\r\nConstruction\r\nFisht Olympic Stadium was designed by Populous and British design consultancy BuroHappold Engineering. The stadium's roof was built from approximately 36,500 square metres (393,000 sq ft) of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) and was designed to give the roof the appearance of snowy peaks. The bowl opens to the north, allowing a direct view of the Krasnaya Polyana Mountains, and the upper deck is open to the south, allowing a view of the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nThe canopy over the Western and Eastern stands is covered with translucent ethylene tetrafluoroethylene. The material offers superior strength and corrosion resistance. Fisht is a UEFA category 4 stadium.\r\n\r\nThe field size of the Fisht Stadium is 105x68 m. The stadium has four stands: two on the sides under a translucent polycarbonate canopy and two open front stands.\r\n\r\n2006. Initial estimates placed the cost of construction to Russia at 1.7 billion rubles.\r\nThe architectural design was developed by Populous, a company with previous experience in designing similar facilities for Johannesburg.\r\n2008. Site clearing and purchasing of land began.\r\nStarting in 2008, the Government began to clear the territory for the future Olympic facility, buying land from the local population.\r\n2010. Construction of the Fisht Stadium began. A symbolic capsule was planted bearing the message “Believe in yourself, and together we will win” and marking the start of construction.\r\n2011. The initial design was altered. According to some sources, changes were made at the request of Director of the Olympics Opening Ceremony Konstantin Ernst.\r\n2013. Construction of the stadium was completed. The stadium was the last Olympics facility to be commissioned.\r\nHaving opened in 2013, it cost US$779 million to build the stadium. The stadium complex now serves as a training centre and match venue for the Russia national football team, and served as a site for matches during the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\r\n\r\nThe stadium's capacity will be temporarily expanded to 41,220 through temporary seating at the open ends of the stadium. The capacity will be reduced to 40,000 after the World Cup in 2018.\r\n\r\nLocation and access\r\nFisht Stadium is located in Sochi, in the Sochi Olympic Park in Adler, south of the Sochi Airport, at 15 Olympic Avenue. The Fisht Stadium can be reached by buses 57, 117, 125, 134, 173. A suburban electric train Sochi–Adler–Olympic Park also provides access to the stadium.\r\n\r\nSafety and security\r\nBy 15 March 2017, the stadium obtained a building safety certificate, detailing its evacuation routes, fire-fighting systems and emergency response procedures. The certificate was a legal confirmation that Fisht was ready to host matches of the FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup. During the 2018 FIFA World Cup matches, the stadium will be serviced by 2,000 surveillance cameras and 600 EMERCOM employees will be ensuring the security at Fisht.","strStadiumLocation":"Sochi, Krasnodar Krai, Russia","intStadiumCapacity":"47659","strWebsite":"pfcsochi.ru","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/pfcsochi","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/pfcsochi","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/pfcsochi","strDescriptionEN":"PFC Sochi, Professional Football Club Sochi (Russian: Профессиональный футбольный клуб Сочи, romanized: Professional'nyy Futbolny Klub Soči), is a Russian professional football club based in Sochi.

El club disputa sus partidos como local en el Estadio Petrovsky.\r\n\r\nEl equipo fue fundado en 1925 sobre la base de varios equipos de la ciudad de Leningrado y no fue hasta 1936 que adoptó el nombre de Zenit Leningrado, haciendo al equipo formar parte de la sociedad deportiva Zenit. El Zenit ganó su primer título en 1944, cuando se hizo con la Copa de la Unión Soviética y en 1984 se proclamó campeón de la Primera División de la URSS. El club alcanzó sus mejores resultados hasta la fecha a finales de los años 2000, cuando ganó tres Ligas rusas, la Copa de la UEFA y la Supercopa de Europa de 2008. En 2005, la empresa estatal Gazprom pasó a ser accionista mayoritario del club ruso.\r\n\r\nLos colores tradicionales del club son el azul y el blanco. De hecho, su uniforme en el primer campeonato soviético fue el azul acero y blanco, los propios de la sociedad deportiva Zenit, el equipo de los trabajadores de la industria armamentística de Leningrado. Su escudo, salvo en su etapa como Stalinets, apenas ha sufrido variaciones a lo largo de su historia y simplemente consta de la palabra «Zenit» estilizada en carácteres cirílicos. El Zenit ha disputado sus partidos históricamente en el Estadio S.M. Kirov en la Isla Krestovsky, pero también ha utilizado en diversos períodos el Estadio Petrovsky, que es su estadio desde 2006. El Zenit se encuentra actualmente construyendo su propio estadio, que contará con 69 000 espectadores y estará nuevamente situado en la Isla Krestovsky.","strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Russia","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/pyxdjx1534866416.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/xvpqqv1473347032.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qqtqqw1420503897.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/ypxtpq1420503962.jpg","strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/ZenitFootballClub","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
