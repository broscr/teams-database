It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of KS Flamurtari Vlorë. The stadium has a capacity of 16,500 people.\r\n\r\nBefore the construction of the stadium, Flamurtari Vlorë played their home games on a field known as Varri i Halimit, which translates to Halimi's Tomb. The field was located near Uji i Ftohtë, which is where the club's training ground is located. The stadium was built in 1961 with an initial capacity of 6,500, and was expanded to 11,000 in 1975 following a reconstruction. During the club's golden era the stadium would attract crowds of up to 15,000 spectators and in 1987 when the club faced FC Barcelona in the UEFA Cup there was a crowd of 18,500, making it the ground's record attendance. Between 2004 and 2012 the ground was under recurring development with the aid of the Albanian Football Association which saw the ground converted into an all-seater stadium with a capacity of 8,200. In addition to the construction of the stands and the installation of seats, a new parking lot was built and floodlights were installed for the first time.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013 the new pitch was laid which was funded equally by the club and the Albanian Football Association and by the end of 2014-2015 season the stadium will be fully reconstructed and covered.","strStadiumLocation":"Vlorë, Albania","intStadiumCapacity":"8500","strWebsite":"flamurtari.al","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/FlamurtariFaqjaZyrtare","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/flamurtari_f_c","strDescriptionEN":"Flamurtari Vlorë is a professional football club based in Vlorë, Albania.
