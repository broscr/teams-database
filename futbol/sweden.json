They play in the Allsvenskan and have spent most of their history in the top tier of Swedish football. Their homeground is Borås Arena, where they have played since 17 April 2005.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1904 by a group of 19 youngsters which all were 14–15 years old. Borås Fotbollslag was formed in Ordenshuset at Landala (today Knalleland) on 26 June 1904. The main protagonist in the formation, Carl Larson, who in addition to football also practiced athletics and wrestling. Claimed the reason was that the main sports club in the city, Borås Athletic and Sports Society, would not exert football in their program.\r\n\r\nCarl Larson, however, found that there were too many clubs containing the city name Borås which contributed to the name change in 1906 by Riksidrottsförbundet to the current, IF Elfsborg. The name is derived from Älvsborg County where instead of making use of the modern spelling Älvsborg, they used out of the older spelling with an E. The same goes for the club colours, reflected in their crest and kit, yellow and black. Colors that are taken from Älvsborg Regiment, Elfsborg would not only represent a city but a whole region.

The current record attendance is 17,070 and was set 4 July 2005 in a game between IF Elfsborg and Kalmar FF which marked the return of both Anders Svensson and Mathias Svensson.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was originally scheduled to be a tournament site for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, but a sponsorship conflict with Max fast food chain's location at the stadium and official UEFA sponsor McDonald's, plus a contractual requirement for official sponsors to have a monopoly over the stadium's area, and a refusal to close the restaurant led to it losing its status as a site for the tournament.\r\n\r\nBorås Arena didn't only open a new era for IF Elfsborg but also for other clubs in Allsvenskan, Elfsborg was the first club to build a new arena owned by their investment company. Many other clubs have built new arenas copying the model Elfsborg set up, trying to own their arena which gives big economic resources.","strStadiumLocation":"Borås, Sweden","intStadiumCapacity":"17800","strWebsite":"www.norrbyif.se","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Norrby IF is a Swedish football club from Borås.

Hugo Levin, football player and the secretary of Örgyte IS, was one of many involved in the building of Walhalla and had several positions in Gothenburg football. Walhalla was inaugurated by a match between Örgryte and German champions Viktoria Berlin. Between 1910–1924 Örgryte IS played in the Swedish series, a series that lacked national status despite participation by leading teams. Öis won the series in 1910, 1912 and 1924 the team won the 1924 Western series, and then the final against AIK.

Öster was formed on 20 April 1930 as Östers Fotbollförening, before adopting the name \"Östers IF\" in 1932. The club is affiliated to the Smålands Fotbollförbund.\r\n\r\nIn 1968, their first season in Allsvenskan, Öster became the first team ever to win the national title at their first attempt (newly-promoted IF Elfsborg won the league in 1961 but had played in, and been winners of, the championship in the past). This win ignited the team's 'golden age' which lasted until the early 1980s and saw them win a total of four Swedish championships.\r\n\r\nOn 31 March 2011, Öster broke ground on their new arena, Myresjöhus Arena, which was inaugurated in August 2012.

They were not part of the upper divisions in the early days of swedish football and only made their first appearance in the third tier in 1947. During the 1950s and early-1960s the club made a push to raise the level of football by inviting and playing against foreign teams such as Flamengo, Juventus and Fluminense. This coupled with an increase in the amount of training helped the team establish themselves in the second tier.\r\n\r\nIn 1961 Öster had their first chance ever to qualify for Allsvenskan but ended up in last place in the four team promotion playoffs. Success in the promotion playoffs would instead come six years later in 1967 when they beat IK Brage in the deciding game in front of a home crowd of 26,404 people. Öster defied the odds during their first season in the top division and won the league on goal difference after a total of four teams had ended the season on exactly the same number of points. Following their championship title the club had ten years of solid Allsvenskan finishes before becoming dominant in the late-1970s and early-1980s where they won the league three times in four years.\r\n\r\nAfter that successful era followed a slow decline over the next couple of decades which culminated in their relegation to the second tier in 1998.

The club was founded by Syriac-Aramean immigrants in 1977 as Suryoyo Sportklubb, or Suryoyo SK. In 1986, its name was changed to Syrianska SK. The club adopted its present name as it grew and advanced through the league system. In 2010, after two years in Superettan, Syrianska was promoted to Allsvenskan (the highest tier in Swedish football) for the first time in club history. This made Syrianska FC the 61st team to play in Allsvenskan. Since the Syriac people do not have an official national team, Syrianska is often seen as a substitute.\r\n\r\nSyrianska FC has a worldwide fan base. Their promotion to Allsvenskan received extensive coverage on Swedish TV sports programs and in documentaries and domestic and foreign magazines.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nSee caption\r\nChart showing the progress of Syrianska FC through the Swedish football league system. The shades of gray represent league divisions.\r\nThe Syriac Federation, based in Södertälje, founded the Suryoyo Sportklubb in 1977. The club was given a spot in Division 7 East. Six years later, it advanced from Division 7 to Division 6. In 1985, Suryoyo won the division and were promoted to Division 5. In 1986, the club changed its name to Syrianska SK. Two years later, Syrianska FC won Division 5 and advanced to Division 4 (where they played until 1990, when they advanced to Division 3).\r\n\r\nSyrianska won the league as newcomers, and advanced to Division 2 (the third tier of Swedish football at the time) in 1993. In 1995, Syrianska FC was relegated to Division 3 for the first time in club history. The following year, its board set a goal of \"Division 1 in 2001.\" In 1999, Syrianska was again promoted to Division 2. In 2000, Syrianska finished in third place after a strong season as newcomers and began investing in youth activities. The following year, they won Division 2 with 53 points and 65 goals. Syrianska attained their goal of winning the series, but did not advance to Superettan after their qualifier against Åtvidabergs FF. The series was played in two matches, the home match before a crowd of 6,435.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Syrianska set a new goal of reaching Superettan by 2006. The following year, Syrianska had a mid-table position in Division 1 and again missed promotion in a Superettan qualifier. Syrianska lost at home against Qviding FIF 0-2, and won the away match 2-1. In 2006, with Özcan Melkemichel as coach, the club had their best season start and the new stadium in Södertälje became their home. After an injury-filled 2006-2007 season, Syrianska defeated Assyriska 2-1 in a derby match before 7,146 fans. In the second match, Syrianska again defeated Assyriska 1-0 on a goal by Robert Massi in front of 6,313 spectators. The club would have won the division, but a points deduction derailed them to fourth place.\r\n\r\nBefore the series started in 2008, Syrianska played at home in the Svenska Cupen against Hammarby IF (a club from the Allsvenskan league) in a game broadcast by TV4. Hammarby led 4-0 into halftime, when Syrianska made a comeback. Goals from a Rabi Elias penalty, Mattias Metes' double and a Semir Metes one-strike tied the score at 4-4. Hammarby eventually scored two quick goals to win, 6-4.\r\n\r\nSyrianska ensured a league victory with two rounds remaining, and finished with 59 points. In 2009, they played their first season in Superettan (Sweden's second-highest division). The club finished in fourth place, one point behind the third-place team. Syrianska won the Superettan league in 2010, with TV4 broadcasting nine of their matches. They ended the season with 56 points and 46 goals. Peter Ijeh led the team scoring with 17 goals, and for the first time in club history Syrianska was promoted to the Allsvenskan.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 Syrianska played their second season in Allsvenskan, finishing in 13th place with 34 points and 35 goals. They remained in Allsvenskan for the following season, when they finished last and were relegated to Superettan. In 2014 the club finished in tenth place with 10 wins, 4 draws and 11 losses, earning them a stay in the Superettan. In 2015, Syrianska finished the Superettan season in seventh place with 43 points. The following year they finished in 13th place, and survived a relegation playoff for a fourth straight season in the Superettan. In 2017, however, Syrianska finished fifteenth (next to last) and were relegated to Division 1.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Sweden","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/uuyvyu1429976693.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/wyrtvx1423840337.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"135666","idSoccerXML":"4711","idAPIfootball":"369","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Trelleborgs FF","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Trelleborgs Fotbollsförening","intFormedYear":"1926","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Swedish Superettan","idLeague":"4403","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Vångavallen","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/5ma4yv1560766044.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Vångavallen is a multi-purpose stadium in Trelleborg, Sweden.
