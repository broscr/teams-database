The club was for a time known as FC Den Haag , with ADO representing the amateur branch of the club. Despite being from one of the traditional three large Dutch cities, it has not been able to match AFC Ajax, Feyenoord or PSV in terms of success in the Eredivisie or in European competition. There is nonetheless a big rivalry with Ajax and Feyenoord. The words Alles Door Oefening translates into Everything Through Practice in Dutch.\r\n\r\nOn 1 February 1905, the club Alles Door Oefening (ADO) was founded in café 'Het Hof van Berlijn' (now: De Paap) in The Hague. In the first years of its existence, the club endured some difficult times as many members refused to pay their fees and the sport of cricket was more popular in the city. ADO started out in the local Haagsche Voetbal Bond, but promoted to the national Nederlandsche Voetbal Bond in 1912. That year they promoted to the 3rd level (3e klasse NVB) and two years later they even earned the championship on that level.\r\n\r\nAfter moving to the Zuiderpark stadium in 1925, ADO continued to grow to a club of some significance. In 1926, the club earned promotion to the highest national level, the 'Eerste Klasse'. In the following years the red-green-white team struggled not to be relegated at first, but rose to the top of the league at the end of the 1930s. In 1939 the club just missed the class title after losing to DWS in Amsterdam. In 1940 the title seemed very close again, but another 2nd place finish was the highest achievable position after the club saw many players being drafted in the army with World War II closing in. This time another club from Amsterdam, Blauw-Wit, grabbed the title. In 1941, ADO finally won their class and moved on to the national champion's competition, losing that to Heracles.\r\n\r\nIn the 1941–42 season all the stars were aligned, and although the War made everday life harder and harder, the club seemed undefeatable. After winning their league, often by many goals difference, ADO moved on to the national champion's competition and fought for the title with Heerenveen, AGOVV, Eindhoven and Blauw-Wit. A 5–2 victory over AGOVV finally brought ADO their first national title. In 1943 ADO won another title, amongst others by beating legend Abe Lenstra's Heerenveen 8–2.\r\n\r\nThe Hague had to wait until the 1960s for more successes from their local club. After Ernst Happel joined ADO as a coach in 1962, the club worked their way to the top of the league again. They finished 3rd in the final ranking in 1965. In 1963, 1964 and 1966 ADO played in the national cupfinal, the KNVB Beker, but lost. In 1968 they again reached the final, and this time beat Ajax to win it. In the 1970–71 season, ADO started the league with 17 games undefeated and were at the top of the national league, but ended their season as No. 3.\r\n\r\nIn 1967, ADO played a summer in North America's United Soccer Association, under the name San Francisco Golden Gate Gales. The club finished tied for second in the Western Division.\r\n\r\nAfter a long spell in the country's second tier of league football, ADO Den Haag played four seasons in the Eredivisie then were relegated again in the 2006–07 season. However, after finishing 6th in the 2007–08 season, they went on to win the play-offs, meaning promotion back to the Eredivisie for 2008–09. The club's new home is the 15,000 seater Kyocera Stadion; formerly known as the Den Haag Stadion. They used to play the home games at the Zuiderpark Stadion. Their home colors are yellow and green. They started the 2008–09 season with two wins, which put them on top of the Eredivisie for the first time in 32 years. In the season 2009–2010 the average attendance was 11,745 people.\r\n\r\nThe team had a great success in season 2010–2011. Beating rival AFC Ajax 2 times was one of the best results that year. ADO Den Haag ended 7th in the Eredivisie and won the play-offs (beating Roda JC and FC Groningen) which offered the last Dutch Europa League ticket. They won the first matches against FK Tauras (3–2, 2–0) but lost the first away leg for the third qualifying round against AC Omonia Nicosia, by 3–0, at Nicosia.\r\n\r\nADO supporters have strong links with Welsh club Swansea City. Flags of the respective clubs are often flown at the matches of the other club, and both clubs regularly hold pre-season friendly matches. Legia Warszawa (Poland), Club Brugge (Belgium), and Juventus (Italy) also share strong supporter links with ADO Den Haag.\r\n\r\nRivalry with fellow Dutch teams is, however, less friendly and ADO achieved notoriety following an incident after beating Ajax on 20 March 2011. Anti-semitic songs including \"Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the Gas\" were sung not only by ADO supporters but also by their midfielder Lex Immers who was subsequently suspended for 5 matches.\r\n\r\nIn 2004 a domestic match between ADO Den Haag and PSV Eindhoven was abandoned after 80 minutes due to racist chanting from the crowd.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":"El Haaglandse Football Club Alles Door Oefening Den Haag, conocido mundialmente como ADO Den Haag o la cigueña, es un club de fútbol de La Haya, Países Bajos.

Historically, Ajax (named after the legendary Greek hero) has been the most successful club in the Netherlands, with 33 Eredivisie titles and 19 KNVB Cups. It has continuously played in the Eredivisie, since the league's inception in 1956 and, along with Feyenoord and PSV, it is one of the country's \"big three\" clubs that have dominated that competition.\r\n\r\nAjax has historically been one of the most successful clubs in the world. According to the IFFHS, Ajax were the seventh-most successful European club of the 20th century and The World's Club Team of the Year in 1992. According to German magazine Kicker, Ajax were the second-most successful European club of the 20th century. The club is one of the five teams that has earned the right to keep the European Cup and to wear a multiple-winner badge; they won consecutively in 1971–1973. In 1972, they completed the continental treble by winning the Eredivisie, KNVB Cup, and the European Cup. It also won the first organized UEFA Super Cup in 1972 against Glasgow Rangers (played in 1973). Ajax's last international trophies were the 1995 Intercontinental Cup, 1995 UEFA Super Cup and the 1995 Champions League, where they defeated Milan in the final; they lost the 1996 Champions League final on penalties to Juventus.

AZ lost the match 3–0, with Gilberto Silva scoring the stadium's first ever goal. The first Eredivisie game against NAC Breda was won 8–1 by the home team with the German midfielder Simon Cziommer scoring a hat-trick.\r\n\r\nAFAS Stadion replaces the club's former ground, Alkmaarder Hout.

The official name is AFAS Stadion, but some supporters call it Victorie Stadion, a name that alludes to the turning point victory over Spanish troops besieging Alkmaar during the Eighty Years' War.\r\nIn order to further grow the club’s budget the AZ Board decided to extend the capacity of the new stadium to minimum 30,000 seats. The extension will be realised to construct a 2nd tier to three of the four stands. The main stand with all technical areas, VIP & sponsor and media facilities will remain in place.

The club plays in the Eredivisie, the highest professional football league in the Netherlands.\r\nAZ was founded on 10 May 1967 as AZ '67, the result of a merger of Alkmaar '54 and FC Zaanstreek. FC Zaanstreek was formed in 1964, continuing the professional adventure of the Kooger Football Club (KFC). KFC had been founded in 1910, had nearly become National Champion in 1934 through a narrow loss to Ajax in the finals, and had been professional since 1955.\r\nIn 1964, the brothers Cees and Klaas Molenaar, former players for KFC and owners of a growing appliance store chain, sought to create a powerful football team in Zaanstreek by merging the two local professional teams: KFC and Zaanlandsche Football Club.\r\nAfter this merger failed, they successfully merged KFC (now \"FC Zaanstreek\") with Alkmaar '54; the team would be based in Alkmaar. Partially through the hiring of expensive foreign players, the new club soon acquired large debts.\r\nFortunately in 1972 the Molenaar brothers bailed it out and invested heavily in the club, to the point that AZ '67 were successful in the late seventies and early eighties, regularly playing European football from 1977 to 1982 whilst also winning the Dutch Cup three times over that period.\r\n\r\nAfter four close league campaigns AZ finally became Dutch champions in 1981, they were the only team other than the \"big three\" (Ajax, Feyenoord, and PSV) to do so in a 44-year period spanning from 1965 to 2009, when AZ once again won the league title. They won the 1980–81 season with overwhelming power, winning 27 of 34 matches and only losing once whilst scoring a club record 101 goals and conceding just 30 goals.\r\n\r\nThe same season AZ reached the final of the UEFA Cup, losing 5–4 on aggregate to Ipswich Town. The next year in the UEFA Champions League they lost in the second round 3–2 on aggregate to Liverpool.\r\nGeorg Keßler was AZ's manager over most of these years (1978–82), while star players included: Kees Kist the club's highest ever goalscorer with 212 goals and the first ever Dutchman to win the European Golden Boot in 1979 when he scored 34 goals in a season; Jan Peters who played 120 games for AZ during this period scoring 30 goals from midfield; Hugo Hovenkamp played 239 games in defence for AZ from 1975–83 as well as receiving 31 caps for the Netherlands from 1977–83 and playing each game in Euro '80 while an AZ player. John Metgod spent six years at AZ playing 195 games as a defender, scoring 26 goals including a goal against Ipswich Town in the final of the UEFA Cup. Like Hovenkamp, Metgod was included in the Netherlands squad for Euro '80; The Danish forward Kristen Nygaard who spent 10 years at AZ scoring 104 goals in 363 games between 1972 and 1982.\r\nThe club deteriorated after Klaas Molenaar left the club in 1985 (Cees died in 1979). AZ were relegated in 1988 from the Eredivisie.\r\nThe involvement of businessman Dirk Scheringa in the mid 1990s marked the revival of the club as AZ returned to the Eredivisie in 1998.\r\n\r\nAfter a 22-year hiatus from European football AZ appeared in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup advancing to the semi-finals. The second leg of the semi-final against Sporting CP had a heart-breaking conclusion, when Sporting scored in the 122nd minute (2 minutes into stoppage time) to reach an aggregate score of 4–4, Sporting advanced to the Final thanks to the away goals rule. In the same season AZ finished third in the Eredivisie, qualifying for the UEFA Cup again. These were great achievements for the club which does not have a similar sized fanbase relative to Eredivisie and European rivals; AZ's home ground until the 2006–07 season, the Alkmaarderhout, had a capacity of only 8,390.\r\nIn the summer of 2006, the club moved to a new 17,000 capacity stadium AZ Stadion.\r\nAZ had a very good 2006–07 season, despite ending in disaster. Going into the last game of the 2006–07 season, AZ led PSV and Ajax by goal difference in the Eredivisie, but ended up third after losing their last match against the now relegated and bottom of the table Excelsior, playing with 10 men for 80 minutes. Furthermore AZ lost the KNVB Cup final to Ajax 8–7 after a penalty shoot-out and also lost to Ajax over two play-off games for the Champions League. After the season, key players like Tim de Cler, Danny Koevermans, and Shota Arveladze left the team.\r\nA remarkable run ended in the 2007–08 season; AZ lost a group game against Everton 3–2 in the UEFA Cup which ended an unbeaten run of 32 home matches in European competitions, a record which ran from 1977 to 2007. Also on this season AZ performed so badly (first round loss in the KNVB Cup, elimination from the UEFA Cup group stage and 11th place league finish), that team manager Louis van Gaal felt obliged to hand in his resignation in March 2008. However, after protests from the players and directors, van Gaal withdrew his resignation.\r\nThe 2008–09 season had an unpromising start with two defeats against NAC Breda and ADO Den Haag. However, starting with a 1–0 victory over defending league champions PSV, AZ didn't lose a game in the next 28 matches, including a run of 11 matches where AZ did not concede an opposition goal. Three weeks before the end of the season AZ became Eredivisie champions beating nearest rivals Twente and Ajax comfortably. Being league champions, AZ qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the second time, but only took four points from six matches and finished bottom of their group.\r\nRonald Koeman succeeded Louis van Gaal after the 2008–09 season. Van Gaal had already left for Bayern Munich after becoming league champions with AZ. Koeman became the manager for AZ on 17 May 2009. On 5 December 2009 AZ announced that Koeman no longer was in charge of AZ, after losing 7 of the first 16 games in his reign. Former Rangers and Zenit St. Petersburg manager Dick Advocaat took over for the rest of the season. Under Advocaat, AZ achieved some good results and secured European football for the next season.\r\n\r\nFor the 2010–11 season AZ appointed Gertjan Verbeek as their new manager. AZ finished the 2010–11 season in 4th place, securing Europa League football for the next season. In the KNVB Cup AZ reached the last eight, where they were beaten by rivals Ajax with 1–0. AZ finished third in their Europa League group, thus not qualifying for the knock out round.\r\n\r\nThe 2011–12 season AZ finished the Eredivisie in 4th place and performed significantly better in cup competitions, reaching the semi-finals in the KNVB cup (losing to Heracles Almelo after extra time) and the quarter-finals in the Europa League, ultimately losing to Valencia after beating Udinese, Anderlecht, Malmö FF, Austria Wien, Metalist Kharkiv, Aalesund and FK Baumit Jablonec.\r\n\r\nOn 21 December 2011, during the quarter-finals of the KNVB Cup, a 19 year old Ajax fan entered the Amsterdam ArenA pitch in the 36th minute, with Ajax winning 1–0, attacking AZ goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado. The fan slipped and Alvarado kicked the fan twice, which led to the goalkeeper being sent off. Following this, Gertjan Verbeek ordered his players to leave the pitch for the dressing room in protest. Later, the match was played again on 19 January 2012, with Alvarado's red card rescinded. AZ won the match 3–2.\r\n\r\nThe 2012–13 season started in the Europa League with a qualifying play-off round against Guus Hiddinks Anzhi Makhachkala, AZ were hammered 6–0 on aggregate. Disappointingly AZ finished the Eredivisie in 10th place, however AZ won silverware by winning the domestic cup after beating PSV 2-1. Winning the KNVB Beker AZ automatically qualified for Europa League football despite finishing the league in tenth position and out of the league's Europa League play-off system.\r\nIn September 2013, just a day after emphatically beating PSV, then league leaders, Verbeek was dismissed as first team manager by the club due to 'a lack of chemistry' between the management and players. He was replaced by Dick Advocaat for the rest of the season until a permanent replacement was found. Advocaat took AZ to the semi-finals of the KNVB Beker, the quarter-finals of the Europa League and 8th in the league, ultimately losing to FC Groningen in Europa League play-off final round (their 58th game of the season, a club record).\r\nThe 2014–15 season started with a new manager at the helm, former SC Heerenveen manager and Ajax player Marco van Basten.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":"El Alkmaar Zaanstreek, más conocido por su abreviación, AZ, es un club de fútbol de los Países Bajos, de la ciudad de Alkmaar en la provincia de Holanda Septentrional.

The club was relegated from the top Dutch league, Eredivisie in 2007–08, and promoted back to the Eredivisie at the end of the 2009–10 season. After their relegation in 2012, the team returned to the Eredivisie two years later.\r\n\r\nUntil 2015, Excelsior was a satellite club of Feyenoord. As such, Feyenoord gave Excelsior money and players (either on loan or free transfer). In 2005, the link between the two clubs was severed. It was reinstated in 2009, resulting in the loan of several Feyenoord players to Excelsior for the 2009–10 season. Excelsior's home stadium is the Stadion Woudestein, which has a capacity of about 4,500, one of the smallest stadiums hosting professional football in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe main rival of Excelsior is Sparta, another professional football team from Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nEarly history\r\nExcelsior were officially formed on 23 July 1902 as Rotterdamse Voetbal en Atletiek Vereniging Excelsior (English: Rotterdam Football and Athletics Club Excelsior). However, the initial founders of the club, a group of close friends located in the Kralingen district of Rotterdam, were already playing their football matches together on the fields of the eighteenth century buitenplaats Woudesteyn. After the actual establishment of the club, the municipality officially gave permission to use the land. As football was still an elite sport at the beginning of the 20th century, Excelsior became one of the first working class clubs in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nIn the season 1945–46, Excelsior gained their first success by promoting to the Eerste Klasse, the highest tier of Dutch football before professional football was introduced in 1954. The deciding match against VUC was played in De Kuip and attracted 52.000 spectators. Excelsior relegated in the next season, but managed to promote for the second time in the season 1951–52. After the introduction of professional football, Excelsior won the Eerste Divisie championship three times (1974, 1979 and 2006) and promoted to the Eredivisie various times, usually to relegate not long afterwards.\r\n\r\nExcelsior once reached the KNVB Cup final in the season 1929–30, but lost the match to fellow Rotterdam club Feyenoord (0–1). Excelsior's biggest pre-war achievement was the win of the Zilveren Bal trophy. Excelsior beat Feyenoord (5–0) in the finals of the highly rated pre-season tournament.\r\n\r\nPioneering\r\nBesides Excelsior, there are two more professional clubs from Rotterdam; Feyenoord and Sparta. Being the smallest professional club in Rotterdam, Excelsior always had to be creative to survive. This creativity made Excelsior play a pioneering role within Dutch football. In the mid-fifties, Excelsior were the leading club behind the introduction of professional football in the Netherlands. When the KNVB continued to refuse payments in football, Excelsior chairman Henk Zon and board member Aad Libregts managed to persuade association president Hans Hopster, in cooperation with the directors of Feyenoord, Sparta and ADO Den Haag. In August 1954 the KNVB accepted the proposal and professional football was introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcelsior in the 1963\/64 Season\r\nIn 1958 Excelsior became the first Dutch club with covered stands. Later, in 1974, Excelsior also were the first Dutch club with shirt advertising. Against the then existing rules, the club put an 'A' on the shirt. The character was supposed to stand for 'Team A', but in reality it stood for Akai, the company of main investor Rob Albers. The KNVB decided to ban the 'A' from the shirt and it would take until 1982 for shirt advertising to be introduced. Akai would adorn the shirts of Excelsior until the season 1999–00.\r\n\r\nFeyenoord partnership\r\nIn 1979, Excelsior chairman Jaap Bontenbal and Feyenoord manager Peter Stephan were at the start of the close relationship between the two Rotterdam clubs Excelsior and Feyenoord. The finger tight relationship that existed between the two clubs since then was contractually sealed in 1996 with an official partnership. Excelsior became Feyenoord's feeder club and provided experience and training for young talented Feyenoord players.\r\n\r\nOn 20 December 2008, Feyenoord announced not to renew the partnership contract with Excelsior due to financial and flexibility reasons. However, only five months later, Feyenoord and Excelsior agreed on an even more extensive partnership. As part of the new agreement, the clubs started a joint regional youth academy called Feyenoord Academy and merged the club's reserve teams. Also, Excelsior continued to be Feyenoord's feeder club. Excelsior's managing director Simon Kelder was pleased with the new extensive partnership: \"I already regretted the earlier withdrawal of cooperation from Feyenoord, but now we get something better in return. It doesn't only reduces the costs, but I am also convinced both clubs will benefit on sportive grounds.\"\r\n\r\nA majority of the Excelsior fans have always been against a partnership with Feyenoord. Michel van der Neut, chairman of Excelsior's supporters club, claimed: \"Excelsior sold her soul with the extended partnership. Excelsior simply stops existing this way.\"\r\n\r\nRecent history\r\nIn 2010 Excelsior returned to the highest tier of Dutch football, after defeating crosstown rival Sparta Rotterdam in the final of the Eredivisie promotion\/relegation play-offs. The team was mostly composed by Feyenoord loanees and was coached by former Feyenoord youth coach Alex Pastoor. In the 2010–11 season Excelsior made a flying start in the Eredivisie, gaining ten points in its first five matches, including a home victory in the Rotterdam derby against Feyenoord (3–2). In the remainder of the season, Excelsior upset some of the larger league teams at home, winning against AZ and getting draws against Groningen and eventual league champions Ajax. In the final match of the regular season, Excelsior got a 4–1 win away at Vitesse Arnhem, a result that left them one goal short of staying up. Finishing 16th, Excelsior had to face FC Den Bosch and Helmond Sport in the relegation \/ promotion play-offs. A 4–2 home win against Helmond sport ensured another season of Eredivisie football for Excelsior.\r\n\r\nExcelsior finished bottom of the table in the Eredivisie at the end of the 2011–12 season, managing only four wins in 34 matches. The club was again relegated to the Eerste Divisie.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Netherlands","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/wqsuux1473534765.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/xtsvyr1475515531.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133762","idSoccerXML":"178","idAPIfootball":"202","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"FC Groningen","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Groningen","intFormedYear":"1971","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Dutch Eredivisie","idLeague":"4337","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Euroborg","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/lez9b51567246458.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"The Hitachi Capital Mobility Stadion, or Hitachi Stadion for short, is the stadium of football club FC Groningen, with a capacity of 22,329 seats and located to the south-east of Groningen.

It is located in Enschede, Netherlands, at the Business & Science Park, near the University of Twente. The stadium has an all-seated capacity of 30,205 with a standard pitch heating system and has a promenade instead of fences around the stands.\r\n\r\nDe Grolsch Veste replaced the old Diekman Stadion as FC Twente's home ground on 22 March 1998. Plans had been afoot to expand and to renovate the old and now demolished Diekman Stadion. However, with a growing fan capacity and with arguments that the location of the Diekman stadium was not strategic enough, the idea was conceived to build a new arena for the FC Twente fans. The Diekman ground also faced problems with its seating plans as a result of previous FIFA regulations which imposed a necessity to construct a seating tribune behind each goal post.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the construction is estimated to have been around 33 million guilders and it took fourteen months to complete, with its foundation stone having been laid on 31 January 1997. Due to the tight budget available, the layout of the stadium was constructed in such a way that future expansions would be possible without the necessity to tear down entire stands.\r\n\r\nThe first match played at the stadium was a 3–0 victory by the home team against PSV on 10 May 1998 in an Eredivisie match. The first goal in the new stadium was scored in the 14th minute by FC Twente player Chris De Witte.\r\n\r\nOn 1 October 2006, the stadium was updated with two big flatscreen video-walls.\r\n\r\nIn May 2008 the Arke Stadion was renamed to De Grolsch Veste with beer brewery Grolsch as sponsor. The brewery is located in the club's hometown Enschede. The name \"Veste\" (fortress) is a reference to Groenlo, a former fortified town that was often besieged and where Grolsch was first brewed.\r\n\r\nOn 5 September 2009 for the first time ever an international (friendly) match was played in the FC Twente stadium when the Netherlands beat Japan 3–0.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 plans were unfolded to increase the stadium capacity to 24,000 seats. The expansion started in January 2008 and was completed in September 2008, just in time for the start of the 2008–2009 season.\r\n\r\nFC Twente is aiming to start a new phase in the stadium expansion in the summer of 2011 which will result in a capacity of 32,000 seats.\r\n\r\nAs part of the combined Netherlands and Belgium bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the stadium is one of five stadiums in the Netherlands selected by the KNVB to host games. This would mean that the stadium capacity needs to be expanded to the minimum required seating of 44,000.\r\n\r\nThe city of Enschede announced on 11 September 2009 that it would officially be a candidate city and that it would fully support FC Twente's ambition to expand the stadium capacity to the minimum required seating of 44,000. In December 2009, IAA Architecten released computer generated images of the proposed 44,000+ stadium with an arched 3rd tier, to complete the main stand.","strStadiumLocation":"Enschede, Netherlands","intStadiumCapacity":"30205","strWebsite":"www.fctwente.nl\/en","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/FCTwente\/","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/fctwente","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/fctwente_official","strDescriptionEN":"FC Twente is a Dutch professional football club from the city of Enschede, playing in the Eredivisie. The club was formed in 1965 by the merger of 1926 Eredivisie Champions, Sportclub Enschede and Enschedese Boys. They were the holders of the 2011 KNVB Cup and Johan Cruijff Schaal trophies, and were Eredivisie champions in the 2009–10 season; the team has also finished as Eredivisie runner-up thrice, was runner-up in the UEFA Cup 1974–75, and has won the KNVB Cup three times. Twente's home ground since 1998 is De Grolsch Veste.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed in 1965 as a merger of two professional clubs, Sportclub Enschede and the Enschedese Boys. One of such predecessors, SC Enschede, had also won a single Eredivisie title in 1926.\r\n\r\nThe first successes of the club started just after the merger of 1965, under the innovative coach Kees Rijvers. Twente finished third in 1969, fourth in 1970, fifth in 1971, third in 1972 and once again in 1973. The team's key figures were local heroes, such as Epi Drost, Eddy Achterberg, Kick van der Vall and Theo Pahlplatz. Their finest Eredivisie season was 1973–1974, in which Twente battled for the Dutch championship with Feyenoord. A head-to-head confrontation in the very last game of the season, in Rotterdam, had to bring the decision. Feyenoord were slightly luckier: 3–2. A second slot and a UEFA Cup ticket—that was all for FC Twente.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Tukkers (as people from the Dutch region of Twente are generally called) almost made the very most out of that UEFA Cup ticket. After beating Juventus in the semi-finals, FC Twente lost to German side Borussia Mönchengladbach in the finals (0–0, 1–5).\r\n\r\nIn 1977 FC Twente wins its first trophy; the KNVB cup after beating PEC Zwolle 3–0.\r\n\r\nThe club's mother corporation (FC Twente '65) was declared bankrupt in the 2002–03 season, almost leading to the end of the club's existence. The club, now chaired by ambitious businessman Joop Munsterman, survived such problems and made it to another KNVB Cup final in 2004, and then finishing in fourth place in 2006–07. In the season 2007–08, FC Twente placed fourth and won the play-offs for a ticket to the Champions League Qualifiers by defeating Ajax in the play-off finals.\r\n\r\nIn the 2008–09 season, FC Twente hired former England manager Steve McClaren as new boss: under his tenure, unseeded Twente entered the draw for the third qualifying round of the Champions League, being drawn against seeded Arsenal. The two legs were played at home on 13 August and away on 27 August 2008. Twente lost 6–0 on aggregate, resulting in their elimination from the Champions League and subsequent entry of the UEFA Cup first round. At domestic level, FC Twente placed second in the Eredivisie (11 points below the league's champion AZ Alkmaar) and again gained entry to the Champions League qualifying rounds as Dutch runners-up, as well as KNVB Cup finalists (then defeated by SC Heerenveen).\r\n\r\nThe 2009–10 season started with Twente being knocked out of the Champions League third qualifying round after a 1–1 aggregate draw against Sporting CP, which sent the Portuguese side through on away goals. The club was then admitted to the Europa League, where it enjoyed a relatively successful path which ended in a 4–2 aggregate defeat at the hands of Werder Bremen in the round of 32. At domestic level, Twente won its first Eredivisie title at the end of a campaign in which they lost just twice, winning 16 of 17 at home. The championship was confirmed on the final day of the season when they beat NAC 2–0 away, making Steve McClaren the first Englishman to guide a Dutch team to a national title since Bobby Robson in 1992. The victory qualified Twente for the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League Group Stage onwards, the club's first appearance in the competition. At the end of the season, Steve McClaren resigned as the manager, moving to German side VfL Wolfsburg, and was replaced by Belgian Michel Preud'homme. Twente continued their success by having a good run during the 2010–11 KNVB Cup, reaching the final on 8 May 2011 at De Kuip. Twente recovered from 2–0 down to defeat Ajax 3–2 in extra time with a winner from Marc Janko, which claimed the club's third KNVB Cup title. One week later, the two teams faced each other in Amsterdam in the final round of matches in the Eredivisie, with Twente leading by a point. However, Ajax gained revenge for the cup defeat by winning 3–1 to claim their first title in seven years. The start of the 2011\/2012 season, under new coach Co Adriaanse who succeeded Michel Preud'homme, featured another clash between the duo in the Amsterdam ArenA, with this time Twente winning 2–1 in their 2nd successive Dutch Super Cup 'Johan Cruijff Schaal' victory.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Netherlands","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/rsrxrt1473534783.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/rxqyss1475515553.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/ryxwwp1426154076.png","strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/FCTwenteTV","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133764","idSoccerXML":"180","idAPIfootball":"207","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"FC Utrecht","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Utrecht","intFormedYear":"1970","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Dutch Eredivisie","idLeague":"4337","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Stadion Galgenwaard","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/qqpryy1420485666.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Stadion Galgenwaard is a football stadium in Utrecht that has been the home of the football club FC Utrecht since 1970.

Founded as Wilhelmina in 1908, the club changed its name in 1912 to SC Feijenoord (since 1973 Feyenoord for international reasons ) and moved to De Kuip in 1937.\r\n\r\nFeyenoord is one of the most successful clubs in the Netherlands, winning 14 Eredivisie titles, 11 KNVB Cups and two Johan Cruijff Shields. The club also has won one European Cup, two UEFA Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. The club is historically one of the three clubs that have dominated the Eredivisie (first tier) of Dutch football, the others being Ajax and PSV. These three clubs have always played in the Eredivisie, since its inception in 1952, and have never been relegated to lower divisions.\r\n\r\nFeyenoord is known as a people's club, with a huge national support. The club's most successful period in history was the 1960s and '70s when Coen Moulijn and Ove Kindvall led the club to six league titles, two European trophies, an Intercontinental cup and thereby becoming the first Dutch club to win the European Cup and the Intercontinental Cup.\r\n\r\nFeyenoord has a longstanding rivalry with Ajax, as a clash between the two biggest cities in The Netherlands, which is called De Klassieker (The Classic). The club's anthem is \"Hand in Hand\".\r\n\r\nThe football club Wilhelmina was founded in the pub De Vereeniging on 19 July 1908 and played in blue-sleeved red shirts and white shorts. Between 1908, 1910, 1911 and 1912, the club underwent a series of changes of name and team colours, becoming Hillesluise Football Club in 1909 and then RVV Celeritas. Upon earning promotion to the National football association in 1912, the club renamed to become SC Feijenoord, after the city district in which the team was founded and again changed uniform, adopting the red and white shirts, black shorts and black socks they still wear today. In 1917, Feijenoord were promoted to the highest level of Dutch football, 1e klasse (1st division) and moved to the ground Kromme Zandweg.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Netherlands","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/uturtx1473534803.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/vvqywx1475515597.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/uwtysx1426074929.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/tusrsw1420504853.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wyvrux1420504747.jpg","strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133773","idSoccerXML":"189","idAPIfootball":"203","intLoved":"1","strTeam":"NAC Breda","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1912","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Dutch Eerste Divisie","idLeague":"4641","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Rat Verlegh Stadion","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/xpxquq1421484580.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"The Rat Verlegh Stadion is a multi-purpose stadium in Breda, Netherlands.

NAC Breda play in the Rat Verlegh Stadium, named after their most important player, Antoon 'Rat' Verlegh.

In their history, NAC won one national title in 1921 and won one Cup in 1973.\r\n\r\nNAC was founded on September 19, 1912, when the two clubs ADVENDO and NOAD merged to one club. NOAD is a Dutch abbreviation for Nooit Ophouden, Altijd Doorgaan (English translation: Never give up, always persevere), while ADVENDO is a Dutch abbreviation for Aangenaam Door Vermaak En Nuttig Door Ontspanning (English: Pleasant for its entertainment and useful for its relaxation), the C stands for Combinatie (combination). The full name of NAC Breda expands to Nooit opgeven altijd doorgaan, Aangenaam door vermaak en nuttig door ontspanning, Combinatie Breda, the longest football club name in the world. Early 2003 NAC added, as a symbol of gratitude, Breda to their club name, after the City of Breda bought NAC’s Rat Verleghstadium to help the club to cope with financial problems. At the end of season 2009\/2010 it appeared, despite earlier denials by management and the chairman, that NAC had a debt of 3.2 million Euros. The crisis lead to the resignation of several board members and the installation of a new board and the appointment of Ed Busselaar as interim managing director. Finally it appeared that NAC had a debt of 7.1 million Euros.

With a capacity of 35,000, it is the third-largest football stadium in the country. Established as the Philips Sportpark, it was constructed as a sports field for Philips employees in 1910. The Philips Elftal played football matches from 1911 until 1913, when the team was succeeded by PSV Eindhoven. Since 1913, they have used the ground has its home base.\r\n\r\nThe stadium has gone through several extensions in its history: after a wooden stand in 1916, seating and standing places slowly enclosed the field throughout the first decades. Two extensive renovations in the 1970s and 1990s first created a covered stadium, and then a two-tiered ground with extensive commercial spaces. The completion of the four corners in 2002 eventually led to its current capacity.\r\n\r\nThe Philips Stadion currently holds a four-star rating by UEFA. It has hosted a range of Netherlands national team fixtures since 1971. In 2013, PSV's reserve team Jong PSV also played their league matches at the stadium. They now paly their games at the trainingcomplex De Herdgang. Furthermore the Philips stadion was the location for three UEFA Euro 2000 group stage matches, as well as the 2006 UEFA Cup Final. Aside from football-related purposes, the ground is incidentally used for music concerts.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, the Philips company erected new houses to serve the growing need for employee housing. The area, fittingly named Philipsdorp (‘Philips Village’), was built on walking distance from the Philips factories and located (at that point) in the outskirts of Eindhoven. Urban planner Gerrit Jan de Jongh envisaged a village green in the center, creating a space for leisure and sports. In this green, a football field, a korfball field and a bandstand were planned. The area was named the Philips Sportpark. Meanwhile, Philips founded a football team for its young employees, named Philips Elftal. Their first match marks the first recorded use of the Philips Sportpark: on 15 January 1911, the Philips Elftal won their debut match against Hollandia from Woensel. The Philips Elftal continued to play at the field for two seasons; in 1913 the team was succeeded by PSV, who also took the Philips Sportpark as their home ground. PSV’s first official home game was the Eindhoven derby against EVV on 10 October 1915.\r\n\r\nIn its first years, the field did not include any seating space for spectators. This changed in 1916, when the first wooden stand was built, providing room for 550 viewers. The stand was offered by Philips, who were celebrating their 25th anniversary that year. Later, it was replaced by a new main stand in 1933, providing seating space for 900 spectators. Five years later, during PSV’s twenty-fifth anniversary, a scoreboard was installed in the stadium. The board was a gift by the official PSV fan union. In 1941, PSV decided to build stands across the entire ground. The decision was made to create an oval shape with a running track between field and stands, enabling the possibility for athletic, cycling and ice skating matches. After completion, the capacity rose to 18,000. During the Second World War, the ground was claimed by German occupants and used for military purposes. The final days of World War II witnessed great destruction in the city of Eindhoven and also to the stadium itself. Repairs were duly made.\r\n\r\nIn 1953, the main stand was refurbished and extended, creating space for a press room and meeting spaces. Also, a memorial was revealed, commemorating the war victims. In 1958, the running track was removed, making space for a bigger field. New stands are built as well, increasing the capacity to 22,000. Four 40-meter high floodlights were installed by Philips in the stadium in the same year, making evening matches possible. The lights were inaugurated on April 9 with an exhibition match against RSC Anderlecht. A complete renovation of the stadium started in 1969. After its completion in 1977, the stadium was completely enclosed and every seat was covered. The main (south) stand peaked above the other stands. The capacity rose to 26,500, of which 12,000 were for standing spectators. The renovated ground was celebrated with a match against Leeds United. Earlier, the ground was used by the Dutch national football team for the first time. On November 17, 1971, the Netherlands played a qualifying match for the 1972 UEFA European Championship against Luxembourg (8–0).\r\n\r\nIn April 1987, cracks in the south stand were discovered. The damage was caused by an alkali–silica reaction. PSV chairman Jacques Ruts decided to rebuild the stand, and simultaneously provide more space for business relations and sponsors. Up until then, the stadium only offered regular spectator seats. Ruts got inspired by the way American stadiums had built luxury boxes and used them for business opportunities. After the renovation (which costed 40 million guilders), the new south stand was two-tiered, with 830 VIP-seats behind glass in the middle. Also, new offices, a press room, a youth hall and a restaurant were created. The opening of the stand was celebrated with an exhibition match against AC Milan on 17 August 1988. Two years later, the ground changed its name from Philips Sportpark to Philips Stadion.\r\n\r\nIn the nineties, the other stands were also raised to the level of the south stand. The west and east stand were expanded in 1993, and the north stand in 1996. After completion, the seating capacity reached 30,000. Until then, the fanatic part of the PSV support would be located on the so-called L-side on standing terraces. After the renovations in the nineties, the standing terraces disappeared and the fanatic fans moved to the east stand. The renovations in the 1990s were in time for UEFA Euro 2000, held in the Netherlands and Belgium. The Philips Stadion hosted three group matches; Portugal beat England with 3-2, Sweden and Turkey ended in a goalless draw, and Italy won against Sweden (2-1). The last major renovation was the closing of the four open corners of the stadium. The two corners on the north side were built in 2000; the corners on the south side were finalized in 2001. Along with creating more seats, the new corners had window blind-type constructions, which allowed air to flow through in order to let the grass breath. These frames can be closed during events, to protect spectators from weather conditions. The four corners were designed by Toon van Aken.\r\n\r\nIn March 2001, PSV faced 1. FC Kaiserslautern in an UEFA Cup fixture. During the match, fans were provoked by Kaiserslautern players, resulting in spectators attempting to break through a fence separating the stands and the field. After the gate was cracked, PSV coach Eric Gerets and several players had to personally stop the fans from entering the field. After this incident, problems with fan violence faded and in the summer of 2005, the PSV board decided to remove the tall fences around the pitch. They were replaced with 35 inches (90 cm) high railings keeping the spectators off the grass. Unauthorized persons who do invade the pitch will receive a 15,000 euro penalty and a ten-year-ban from visiting the Philips Stadion. The 2006 UEFA Cup Final was held in the Philips Stadion; Sevilla managed to beat Middlesbrough with 4-0. For the final, the stadium was temporarily named ‘PSV Stadion’, because UEFA did not allow the Philips name to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nPress room at the Philips Stadion prior to a press conference.\r\nPlans to further expand the ground to 45,000 seats have been examined, but turned down after the Netherlands lost the 2018 FIFA World Cup bid. In 2011, the ground under the stadium (and the training facilities) were sold for €48,4 million to the Eindhoven municipality in a leasehold estate construction. In recent years, the stadium has gone through several minor modernization programs: the fourth floor was renovated in 2008, LED-powered advertisement boarding was installed by Philips in 2009. In 2012, a modernization plan for the ground was presented. The plan included new entrances, sponsor lodges and parts of the stands. The second floor of the stadium was renovated in 2013. After PSV's reserve team Jong PSV was admitted to the Eerste Divisie, they relocated their home matches to the Philips Stadion.","strStadiumLocation":"Eindhoven","intStadiumCapacity":"36500","strWebsite":"www.psv.nl\/home-english.html","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/PSV\/","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/psv","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/psv","strDescriptionEN":"Philips Sport Vereniging, abbreviated as PSV and internationally known as PSV Eindhoven is a sports club from Eindhoven, The Netherlands. It is best known for its professional football department, currently playing in the Eredivisie, and is one of the country's \"big three\" clubs who have dominated Dutch football (and who are the only three clubs that have never been relegated from the top division).\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1913 as a team for Philips employees. PSV’s history contains two golden eras revolving around the UEFA Cup victory in 1978 and the 1987–88 European Cup victory as part of the continental treble in 1988. The team has won the Eredivisie 21 times, the domestic cup nine times and the Johan Cruijff Shield nine times. Currently, PSV is 28th on the UEFA club coefficients ranking. Throughout the years, PSV established itself as a stepping stone for future world class players like Ruud Gullit, Romário, Ronaldo, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Arjen Robben.\r\n\r\nSince its foundation, it has played in the Philips Stadion and has upheld its club colours (red and white). Its elaborate connection with Philips can be witnessed in its sponsoring, shared technology and board member ties. Fans have named themselves 'boeren' (Dutch pronunciaTo serve the need for activities with Philips employees, the company founded its own football team in 1910: the Philips Elftal. Its ground was the Philips Sportpark, located on the same location as the present day stadium. Financial turmoil and worker strikes led to a quick demise of the team and in 1913, its successor emerged: the Philips Sport Vereniging was founded on 31 August. It was the day that Philips organized celebrations and sports competitions in light of the centennial defeat of the French in the Napoleonic Wars. It was not until 1916 though, that the football department switched its name from Philips Elftal to PSV. Because of World War I, the first possibility to enter a league was in the 1915-16 season. The club's first ever match was a 3-2 defeat against Willem II Reserves on 19 September 1915. The team did achieve promotion that season to a newly created Third Division of the Brabantian FA. Under the guidance of coach Wout Buitenweg, PSV got promoted in 1918 and 1921 as well, eventually reaching the Eerste Klasse. The team got relegated in 1925, but its stint in the Second Division only lasted one year when PSV got promoted again. Since 1926, PSV has always played in the highest possible domestic league.\r\n\r\nThat year, defender Sjef van Run was brought in and a year later Jan van den Broek joined PSV; two players that would shape the squad in the coming years. Behind the scenes, Frans Otten became chairman of the entire PSV sports union. He was responsible for bringing the club to a new level with new accommodations and stadium expansions. After winning the district league in 1929, PSV entered the championship play-offs. In that competition, it won 6 out of 8 matches. A 5-1 win against Velocitas from Groningen meant that PSV was crowned league champions for the first time. In the following three years, PSV won the district league every year, but it could not win the play-offs until 1935. In that year, the team secured the second championship ever in a 2-1 victory against DWS.\r\n\r\nDue to World War II, attendances decreased significantly and in 1940, PSV player Johan Brusselers died in combat. After the war, PSV signed two new strikers: Piet Fransen in 1948 and Coen Dillen in 1949. In 1950, PSV got its first post-war success when the team defeated HFC Haarlem in the KNVB Cup final; the match ended in 4-3 after extra-time. A year later, PSV won the district title after EVV failed to win their final match. Even though coach Sam Wadsworth resigned during the championship play-offs, the title was won after a 2-1 win over Willem II. The 1950-51 season was Dillen’s breakthrough, scoring 21 times and earning the nickname ‘The Canon’. Besides Dillen and Fransen, a memorable player of the early 1950s success was goalkeeper Lieuwe Steiger, who ended up playing 383 matches for PSV.\r\n\r\nIn 1955, PSV became the first Dutch club to enter the European Champion Clubs' Cup. The two matches against SK Rapid Wien ended in 1-6 and 1-0. Other success in the fifties remained absent but in the 1956-57 season, Dillen scored 43 times – a Dutch record that still stands today. The approaching sixties marked a shift in player’s heritage; the team went from mostly Brabantian men to players nationwide. Representative for this policy were defender Roel Wiersma, who arrived in 1954 and captained the team for a decade, and Piet van der Kuil, who came from Ajax for 59,000 euro (PSV's biggest transfer fee so far). Dillen left the club in 1961 after being club top scorer every year from 1953 to 1960. In 1962, Otten also decided to quit as chairman of the sports union. By then, board member Ben van Gelder had gradually started to mold the club in his way. Throughout the next two decades, he became responsible for turning PSV into a full-fledged professional organization., Dutch for either peasants or farmers), taking pride in Eindhoven's status of being a provincial city and their Brabantian heritage.\r\n\r\nIn the 1962-63 season, marking PSV’s fifty-year anniversary, the club appointed Bram Appel as the new coach. The first results were disastrous though, with a mere six points from the first six fixtures. A sudden revival led to a first place at the winter break and a 5-2 victory over Ajax in June meant that PSV could celebrate its fourth league title, with Pierre Kerkhofs leading the goal scorer charts with twenty-two goals. The following year, PSV ended second in the league but more significantly, reached the Europa Cup I quarter-finals for the first time, where it was eliminated by FC Zürich. Appel remained coach for five years; the position was later on followed up with short stints by Milan Nikolić and Wim Blokland. Willy van der Kuijlen was signed in 1964, who produced 23 league goals in 1966 and became the league’s top scorer at age 20.\r\n\r\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Kurt Linder coached PSV. His team reached two Dutch cup finals and the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup. Van der Kuijlen had trouble fulfilling his promise after an encouraging career start in the sixties, though - partly because of a lack of chemistry between him and Linder’s harsh coaching style. The early seventies in football were dominated by Ajax and Feyenoord and it was not until the appointment of Kees Rijvers as coach in 1972 that would mark the start of increasing success for PSV. With Van der Kuijlen and goalkeeper Jan van Beveren as the stars of the team, Rijvers created a new squad by signing Ralf Edström, Gerrie Deijkers and the twins Willy and René van der Kerkhof. Things improved for Van der Kuijlen when Rijvers built the team around him, giving him a free role in the process. Van der Kuijlen, a technical player, formed a successful striker partnership with Edström, who was famed for his heading ability. It led to a Dutch cup victory in 1974, and after a blistering season start (no defeats in the first season half) and 28 goals by Van der Kuijlen, PSV also won the league for the fifth time in 1975.\r\n\r\nA year later, PSV managed to win its first ‘double’. With defender Huub Stevens joining the team, the league title was secured after a 4-1 result against Feyenoord. Earlier, a 1-0 victory over Roda JC meant that PSV won the national cup as well. In the European Cup, the final was only narrowly missed after a 1-0 aggregate loss against AS Saint-Étienne in the semi-finals. After the two consecutive titles, PSV ended second in 1977. The following year, Edström left the squad but PSV nonetheless enjoyed a strong league campaign. In April 1978, the team secured the title without a single loss. The domestic cup ended early after a shocking 1-6 first round loss against FC Wageningen (PSV’s biggest home loss ever to date). The UEFA Cup campaign proved to be more successful; after wins against Glenavon, Widzew Lodz, Eintracht Braunschweig and 1. FC Magdeburg, the team faced FC Barcelona. A 3-0 win in the first leg was nullified by the Catalans in the return leg, but a single goal by Nick Deacy in Camp Nou meant that PSV could progress with a 4-3 aggregate win. The two-legged final against SC Bastia first produced a goalless draw in the first match. The return leg in Eindhoven ended in a 3-0 win, with goals by Willy van de Kerkhof, Deijkers and Van der Kuijlen, giving PSV its first European trophy.\r\n\r\nAfter the UEFA Cup victory, the team chemistry started to suffer, which was reflected in the results. Not long after a 6-0 UEFA Cup loss against Saint-Etienne, Rijvers was sacked and the squad disintegrated. Van Beveren, unhappy with the declining success and Rijvers’ departure, left for the United States after 291 league games and years of captaincy. Van Gelder also quit in 1980 and was replaced by Kees Ploegsma. Even though PSV invested in players like Hallvar Thoresen and Jurrie Koolhof, success remained absent. Thijs Libregts' (coach from 1980 until 1983) highest league position was the second place and in 1983, Jan Reker took over. A clash between Van der Kuijlen and Libregts led to the former’s departure in 1982 after nearly 18 seasons at the club.\r\n\r\nIn 1985, chairman Jacques Ruts and Ploegsma decided on a change of direction: Hans Kraay became the new director of football (supervising Reker in 1985-86, and taking over altogether in 1986-87) and PSV started to sign players with flair, like Ruud Gullit, Søren Lerby, Gerald Vanenburg and Eric Gerets. Gullit, who quickly was appointed as captain, contributed to the team that headed the league table for the majority of the 1985–86 Eredivisie and claimed the title after an 8-2 win against Go Ahead Eagles. Being unhappy with his personal development, Gullit heavily criticized PSV and Kraay in a March 1987 interview. The management’s subsequent warning was deemed too lenient by Kraay, who resigned. Gullit’s strained relationship with the club meant that he left for A.C. Milan in the summer for a world record fee of 7,7 million euro. Earlier that year, Guus Hiddink replaced Kraay and Ronald Koeman joined PSV. That season, the squad suffered early eliminations from the Dutch cup and European Cup, but secured the title in the penultimate match.\r\n\r\nThe 1987-88 season turned out to be PSV’s best year in history. The Eredivisie was won four matches before the end after many high scoring matches, leading up to 117 goals. The cup was also won after beating Roda JC 3-2 after extra time. The European Cup campaign started with wins against Fenerbahçe and Rapid Wien. Subsequently, PSV managed to reach the final with only draws. The quarter finals against Bordeaux were decided by Wim Kieft’s away goal. A vicious foul by Hans Gillhaus on Jean Tigana was praised by Koeman, which prompted UEFA to suspend him for the semi-final return leg against Real Madrid. Again, an away goal in the first leg (a notoriously lethargic shot by Edward Linskens in Bernabéu) meant that the second leg’s 0-0 was enough to proceed. The final against Benfica, held in Stuttgart, remained goalless. In the penalty shoot-out, Van Breukelen saved Benfica’s sixth penalty by António Veloso, which meant that PSV had won the European Cup and completed the treble.\r\n\r\nAfter the summer break, Willy van de Kerkhof, present at both the 1978 and 1988 triumphs, was honored with a farewell match. The 1988-89 season again resulted in the double: Hiddink’s squad won the title (albeit with less dominance than the year before) and PSV beat Groningen in the cup final. In comparison, the international competitions were disappointing. The Intercontinental Cup against Nacional ended in a 2-2 draw, but PSV lost the penalty shoot-out with 7-6. The team was also beaten in the UEFA Super Cup by KV Mechelen (3-1 on aggregate). In the European Cup, Real Madrid got its revenge by eliminating PSV in the quarter-finals.\r\n\r\nAfter the European Cup win, PSV outsmarted many clubs by signing Romário. After a first season with 19 league goals, his hat-trick in the November 1989 match against Steaua București (5-1) - including a memorable solo effort – was his big breakthrough. In 1989, after Koeman left, PSV ended second in the league, but won the KNVB Cup after defeating Vitesse (1-0). Hiddink left the team in 1990, to be replaced by Bobby Robson. In his two seasons at the club, PSV won two league titles; the first one on goal difference (with Ajax) and the second one in the penultimate match against Groningen. Meanwhile, Romário - league top scorer in 1989, 1990 and 1991 - was admired by fans, but sometimes also renounced by the squad for being unprofessional and selfish. Robson had frequent clashes with Romário, but the striker never changed his ways. These events, plus the lack of European success meant that Robson was let go in 1992. While Gerets retired, Hans Westerhof took over as coach, but only won the Super Cup in his single season at the helm. In 1993, Romário was transferred to FC Barcelona. Westerhof was replaced by Aad de Mos, who led the team to the third place.\r\n\r\nEarly in the 1994-95 season, De Mos was fired and replaced by Dick Advocaat (after Kees Rijvers temporarily took over). PSV saw Van Breukelen retiring and signed Luc Nilis in 1994, who formed a powerful duo with another signing: a 17-year old Ronaldo. The Brazilian striker scored 30 goals in his debut season, while Nilis was named Dutch Footballer of the Year in an otherwise trophy-less year. After an injury-filled 1995-96 season where he still managed 12 goals, Ronaldo left for Barcelona. That season, PSV won the cup after a 5-2 win against Sparta. In the 1996-97 season, when Harry van Raaij became chairman, Advocaat had created a team with players like Phillip Cocu, Jaap Stam, Boudewijn Zenden and Wim Jonk. It led to the Eredivisie title, with Nilis becoming league top goalscorer (21 goals). In the 1997-98 season, the team came in second behind Ajax in both league and cup. It resulted in Cocu, Stam, Zenden, Jonk and Advocaat leaving PSV, forcing the club to build a new squad. Robson temporarily returned in 1998 for one year so that desired coach Eric Gerets could get his coaching badges. Again, Nilis showed to be highly compatible with a poacher-type striker; new signing Ruud van Nistelrooy scored 31 times in his first season. In the season's last round, PSV beat FC Utrecht 3-2 with a last-minute goal by Arnold Bruggink – just enough for Champions League qualification.\r\n\r\nIn the 1999-2000 season, Van Nistelrooy bagged 29 goals after just 23 matches, but after two serious injuries an imminent transfer to Manchester United was forced to be postponed for a year. PSV were comfortably crowned league champions in Gerets’ debut year, creating a 16 point-gap with runner-up Heerenveen. The 2000–01 Eredivisie was also won with new striker Mateja Kežman, who replaced Van Nistelrooy and the departed Nilis. The cup final was lost to FC Twente after penalties. In the UEFA Cup, PSV faced 1. FC Kaiserslautern at home; fans threatening to storm the field during the match prompted Gerets and some players to personally intervene. PSV was fined by UEFA and forced to play a European match on neutral ground. After Van Nistelrooy left, PSV ended second in the 2001-02 season and got eliminated in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals by Feyenoord.\r\n\r\nGerets was released and Guus Hiddink returned to the club as coach and director of football, with Arjen Robben, Park Ji-Sung, Lee Young-Pyo joining PSV. Their first season immediately brought a league title, secured in the last match against Groningen. But in the 2003-04 season, PSV failed to reclaim the championship. In 2004, the PSV board clashed with Hiddink and Van Raaij concerning the expenditures. Van Raaij left in September and Hiddink never got along with his successor Rob Westerhof, who sided with the board. Even though Kežman and Robben left in 2004, Hiddink had gradually built a powerful squad, with Gomes, Alex, Park, Lee, Van Bommel and the returning Phillip Cocu. The Eredivisie was won five matches before the end and Willem II was beaten in the cup final. After eight consecutive Champions League group stage eliminations, PSV reached the knockout stage. There, they beat AS Monaco 2-1 on aggregate and Olympique Lyonnais after penalties. The first semi-final against AC Milan was lost 2-0. In the return, PSV took a 2-0 lead but a late goal by Massimo Ambrosini ended the hope to reach the final, despite an injury-time third goal by Cocu.\r\n\r\nAfter the 2004-05 season, Van Bommel, Vogel, Park and Lee left. With new signing Timmy Simons and youth prospect Ibrahim Afellay, PSV reached the Champions League knockout stage again. In that round, Olympique Lyonnais revenged PSV by winning 5-0 on aggregate. The team did win the league, but lost the cup final to Ajax. Afterwards, Hiddink left and Ronald Koeman replaced him. Westerhof, who lost support from the board, resigned soon after Hiddink’s departure. Jan Reker became general manager. During the 2006–07 season, league leaders PSV squandered a 12-point lead, enabling AZ and Ajax to equal their 72 points before the last round. A surprise AZ defeat in the last fixture meant that PSV’s 5-1 victory against Vitesse was enough to edge the title win; PSV had a single goal difference with Ajax. Koeman was criticised by the board after losing a big lead, but was eventually allowed to remain as coach. In the 2007-08 season, after Cocu and Alex left, the team was disqualified from the KNVB Cup after fielding a suspended Manuel da Costa. In October, Koeman took up the coaching job at Valencia, prompting PSV to first appoint Jan Wouters and then Sef Vergoossen as caretakers. The fourth title in a row was won in the last match, again against Vitesse. After the title, Gomes and director of football Stan Valckx voiced criticism towards Reker, forcing the club to choose between Reker and Gomes. Subsequently, Reker sacked Valckx and sold Gomes to Tottenham Hotspur.\r\n\r\nHuub Stevens returned as coach in 2008, but disappointing performances and clashes between Stevens and the squad resulted in his resignation six months later. Caretaker Dwight Lodeweges wrapped up the season with a fourth place. The following year, Fred Rutten was appointed as coach. In his first two seasons, PSV reached the third place twice. Meanwhile, the club experienced liquidity problems, but secured its future through loans and property sales. Key players Afellay and Balázs Dzsudzsák were sold and as a consequence, director of football Marcel Brands spent 25 million euro to improve the squad. But in the 2011-12 season, the team dropped out of the title race early again, which led to Rutten’s dismissal. Phillip Cocu finished the season as caretaker, leading the team to a third place and a KNVB Cup after beating Heracles Almelo. For the 2012-13 season, Dick Advocaat became head coach, while Mark van Bommel returned from A.C. Milan. Despite 103 league goals, the team ended as runner-up in both Eredivisie and KNVB Cup. Advocaat, who struggled with the job’s intensity, left after one season. In 2013, Cocu was appointed as head coach.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Netherlands","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/xryxrq1473534831.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/xvxprv1475515640.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/qq52gl1545048437.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wsxvyp1426548908.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/vwwuwx1426548924.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/xxppxt1426548939.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/vsppsu1426548956.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/yjvfed1544972804.jpg","strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133761","idSoccerXML":"177","idAPIfootball":"414","intLoved":"1","strTeam":"Roda JC","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1961","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Dutch Eerste Divisie","idLeague":"4641","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Parkstad Limburg Stadion","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"The Parkstad Limburg Stadion (Dutch pronunciation: ) is a football stadium in Kerkrade, completed in 2000.

Roda JC Kerkrade plays in the Eredivisie. The club was founded after a merger between Rapid JC and Roda Sport in 1962. They were placed in the Eerste Divisie, and after a relegation they were promoted back to the top division in 1973, where they would stay for 41 years until relegating in 2014.

Fans of arch rival MVV, from the provincial capital of Maastricht, pronounce those words condescendingly. In Kerkrade and surroundings however, they are pronounced with pride and respect. The last Dutch coal-mines were closed in the 1960s, but the southeastern part of the Netherlands' most southern province, Limburg, is still referred to as the Mijnstreek ('mine district') today. The coal-mines are still industrious in folk songs in the regional dialect and in the stories of old miners, reminiscing of an era that will never return. Southern Limburg will always be their home. Their team, in most cases, is Roda JC.\r\n\r\nRoda JC's club honours include seven European campaigns and six KNVB cup finals, of which two were won. One of the predecessors in club's \"family tree\" of mergers, Rapid JC, were champions of the Netherlands in 1956. Ten out of eleven players on that Rapid JC team were coal-miners.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Netherlands","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/wrrxtr1421761838.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/rptxsw1475515661.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133759","idSoccerXML":"175","idAPIfootball":"210","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"SC Heerenveen","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Heerenveen","intFormedYear":"1920","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Dutch Eredivisie","idLeague":"4337","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Abe Lenstra Stadion","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/ruwyrx1420774633.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Abe Lenstra Stadion is a football stadium in Heerenveen, Netherlands.

It is the home ground of Sparta Rotterdam. It has a capacity of 11,026.\r\n\r\nHistory and layout\r\nThe stadium is located in the neighbourhood of Spangen, where it was built in 1916 as Stadion Spangen based on a plan of the architects J.H. de Roos and W.F. Overeynder. The name \"Het Kasteel\" (The Castle) is derived from the small building with two small towers which backs onto the south-facing tribune (Kasteel Stand) of the stadium, which looks similar to a castle. This building is the only authentical remain of the original design. It was built in 1916. The castle building, which is currently located along the length of the pitch, was originally positioned behind one of the goals.\r\n\r\nA famous incident took place at het Kasteel in November 1970, when Feyenoord goalkeeper Eddy Treijtel took a goalkick and shot a passing seagull down from the air. The stuffed bird has been on display in the museum at Feyenoord's De Kuip stadion and not in Sparta's museum much to the annoyance of some prominent Sparta supporters.\r\n\r\n1928 Olympic Games\r\nFor the 1928 Summer Olympics in neighboring Amsterdam, the venue hosted two football games. The first was on 5 June when host nation Netherlands defeated Belgium 3-1 while the second was three days later when the Dutch team tied Chile 2-2.\r\n\r\nThrough the years, the stands of \"Stadion Sparta\" were often renovated and extended, but the most radical renovation took place in 1998 and 1999: the stadium was completely rebuilt according to a plan of the architects Zwarts & Jansma. During the renovation, the pitch was turned 90 degrees. At the same time, it was renamed ENECO-stadion, after its main sponsor. That name was soon replaced by the present Het Kasteel (\"The Castle\"), which had already been the popular nickname for the stadium ever since it was built.\r\n\r\nThe Castle was bought in November 2004 by businessman Hans van Heelsbergen, the manager of the textile company Hans Textiel and also the chairman of Sparta Rotterdam. Van Heelsbergen opened in this building a Sparta museum (and an outlet of Hans Textiel).\r\n\r\nTonny van Ede Stand\r\nThe Tonny van Ede stand is on the north side of the ground and stands along the length of the pitch, opposite the Kasteel Stand. The most expensive tickets are to be found here. It houses the changing rooms as well as the corporate boxes, the ticket office and the boardroom. The players' tunnel runs from the centre of this stand onto the pitch between the two dugouts. The stand was named after one of Sparta's most famous sons, Tonny van Ede, in 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\nMain entrance at Tonny van Ede stand\r\nDenis Neville Stand\r\nThe lowest priced tickets for home fans are to be found in the Denis Neville Stand. This is at the east end of the ground behind one of the goals. It houses the more vocal supporters of the club and is usually the first stand to sell-out. The stand was named in honour of one of Sparta's most successful managers, Denis Neville.\r\n\r\nBok de Korver Stand\r\nOpposite the Denis Neville Stand, the Bok de Korver Stand is assigned as the family stand but also houses the away fans. Formerly known as the West Stand, it was named after Sparta legend Bok de Korver.\r\n\r\nKasteel Stand\r\nAttached to the historic Kasteel building, the Kasteel Stand is on the south end of the ground and the club shop is based here as well as the Sparta Museum.","strStadiumLocation":"Rotterdam, Netherlands","intStadiumCapacity":"11926","strWebsite":"www.sparta-rotterdam.nl","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Sparta Rotterdam (Dutch pronunciation: ) is a Dutch professional football club based in Rotterdam. Established on 1 April 1888, Sparta Rotterdam is the oldest professional football team in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nIn the 2017–18 season, Sparta will play in the Eredivisie, the top tier of Dutch professional football. The club is one of three professional football clubs from Rotterdam, the others being Excelsior (est. 1902) and Feyenoord (1908).\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nSparta Rotterdam vs Blackpool F.C., Aug. 1957\r\nOn 1 April 1888, several students from Rotterdam founded a cricket club called Sparta. In July 1888, a football branch of the club was established. In 1890, Sparta played its first real football match, and in 1892 Sparta disbanded the cricket branch. Sparta was promoted to the highest league of Dutch football on 23 April 1893. In 1897, Sparta withdrew from the competition after continuous dubious arbitration of Sparta matches. The club continued to exist, however, and in 1899 the board of Sparta visited a match of Sunderland. Impressed with the red-and-white jersey of the English club, the board decided that Sunderland's colours (red-white striped jersey, black shorts) would henceforth be the colours of Sparta.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, Sparta initiated and organised the first home match of the Netherlands national team, against Belgium. The match, won 4–0 by the Netherlands, was a rematch of a game two weeks prior, when the Netherlands beat Belgium 4–1 in Antwerp, Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe first match at Sparta's new stadium, Het Kasteel (The Castle), in the Spangen area of west Rotterdam, was played on 14 October 1916. The stadium was renovated in 1999 and is still Sparta's stadium.\r\n\r\nUntil the 2002–03 season, Sparta had always played at the highest level, but they were relegated from the top-level Eredivisie in 2002. Sparta returned to the Eredivisie for the 2005–06 season. They were relegated again in 2010. On 20 August 2010, they equalled Ajax's and Heracles Almelo's Dutch league record win when they defeated Almere City 12–1 with Johan Voskamp scoring an Eerste Divisie record 8 goals on his debut. After six years in the Eerste Divisie, Sparta again won promotion to the Eredivisie in April 2016 after a 3–1 win over Jong Ajax won them an unassailable lead over second placed VVV-Venlo.\r\n\r\nSparta has won six national titles (1909, 1911, 1912, 1913, 1915 and 1959) and three national cups (1958, 1962 and 1966).\r\n\r\nThey are known for their loyal fan base.\r\n\r\nMeuse\/Scheldt Cup\r\nThe best footballers of Rotterdam and Antwerp contested a yearly match between 1909 and 1959 for the Meuse- and Scheldt Cup (Maas- en Schelde Beker). It was agreed to play the game at stadium Het Kasteel in Rotterdam and at the Bosuilstadion in Antwerp. The cup was provided in 1909 by Kees van Hasselt from Rotterdam and P.

Vitesse has enjoyed some success in the Eredivisie and featured in the UEFA Cup competition. The owner is a Russian businessman, which makes Vitesse the first Dutch football club owned by a foreigner. \r\nThe idea of conceiving a football team stemmed from the club's early roots as a cricket club.\r\n\r\nVitesse once attracted big name signings into its ranks including Roy Makaay, Nikos Machlas, Sander Westerveld, Danko Lazovic, Pierre van Hooijdonk, Mahamadou Diarra and Philip Cocu. In the 1980s, the club was threatened with bankruptcy, the solution to which was to form a new administrative board to govern both the professionals and the amateur sides. This is because up until the 1980s, the club had incorporated both its professional and its amateur players into its club structure. In 1990, the club reached its most recent KNVB Cup final when it was defeated by PSV Eindhoven on a penalty-kick in the 75' minute from Stan Valckx at De Kuip on 25 April 1990. It was restructured again in 2003 when it could have gone bankrupt, when the timely intervention of the Arnhem city council helped to create a financial rescue package to salvage the club.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 the club was bought by Georgian businessman Merab Jordania, who is a good friend with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Shortly thereafter, the two clubs agreed to a partnership and in the years following, many young Chelsea players have the move to Vitesse on loan, including Nemanja Matić, Gaël Kakuta and both Tomáš Kalas and Patrick van Aanholt twice. The club competed in European competition for the first time in a decade when it qualified for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League as they were winners of the European playoff at the end of the 2011-12 Eredivisie campaign, defeating RKC Waalwijk 5-2 in the two-legged final.\r\n\r\nVitesse finished the 2012-13 Eredivisie campaign in fourth place and thus qualified for the Third Qualifying Round of the Europa League for the following season. After leading the club to their impressive fourth place finish, manager Fred Rutten stepped down from his post after only one season in charge and was replaced by former Vitesse and Feyenoord midfielder Peter Bosz. In July 2013, two of Vitesse's most important first-team players, Marco van Ginkel and Wilfried Bony, were sold for club record fees at the time to Chelsea and Swansea City of the Premier League respectively. Van Ginkel had been named the Dutch Talent of the Year for the previous season and Bony was the Eredivisie top scorer with 31 goals and was named the Dutch Footballer of the Year.\r\nOn 16 August 2010, the former Georgian footballer and now businessman Merab Jordania became the owner of Vitesse. Jordania expressed his ambition for Vitesse to become champion of the Eredivisie league within three years. His first action as owner involved attracting 8 new young players, though no established stars. However, the takeover resulted in some controversy. Some commentators arguing that this takeover was the Dutch equivalent of what had happened in English football, financial globalization and possibly longer-term destabilization, as expressed in the opinions in the local papers. On 22 October 2013 it was announced that Russian billionaire Aleksandr Tsjigirinski was the new owner of Vitesse, while Merab Jordania would remain as chairman of the club.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Netherlands","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/wrptxp1473534864.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133770-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/xyywty1429710558.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qvvsuw1429709953.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/i1md441548156247.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/fdikbb1548156231.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/tswvyr1429709998.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/wwtwur1429710500.jpg","strYoutube":"youtube.com\/user\/VitesseTV","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"136030","idSoccerXML":"4815","idAPIfootball":"204","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"VVV-Venlo","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"VVV","intFormedYear":"1903","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"Dutch Eredivisie","idLeague":"4337","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"De Koel","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/1bcfkl1567246962.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"De Koel, also known as Seacon Stadion – De Koel after the main sponsor, is a multi-purpose stadium in Venlo, Netherlands.
