It is the home of the Australian A-League team, Adelaide United.\r\n\r\nThe stadium now has a capacity of 17,000, of which 15,500 is seated. Home team, Adelaide United regularly fill this capacity, and averaged crowds of over 12,000 to its matches during the 2006\/2007 Season and 2007\/2008 Season. United used the stadium for its home matches in the 2008 AFC Asian Champions League, the 2010 AFC Asian Champions League, and the 2012 AFC Asian Champions League.\r\n\r\nBuilt in 1960, the stadium stands on the site that was once Hindmarsh Oval which housed the West Torrens Football Club of the SANFL from 1905 until 1921, when the team moved to nearby Thebarton Oval which would remain its home until 1989.\r\n\r\nThe Soccer Association of South Australia owned land on a former brick pit on Torrens Road at Brompton named Rowley Park which was located only 5 km from the city, and the original plan was for the land to be the home of Soccer in SA as the site formed a natural bowl. However, the Soccer Association had received negative press regarding its failure to grow grass on the site. Rowley Park also had a tendency to flood during winter as the bottom of \"The Brick Pit\" was below the level of the water table which made playing soccer virtually impossible. The land was eventually leased to a group of speedway drivers and would become the famous Rowley Park Speedway which ran from December 1949 until it closed in April 1979. The land was eventually sold and is now the Kym Bonython housing estate, named for the speedway's long time promoter Kym Bonython.\r\n\r\nWhen it became obvious to the Soccer Association that Rowley Park would be unsuitable as a soccer venue they obtained a lease on Hindmarsh Oval from the Hindmarsh Council. The old Hindmarsh Oval was developed over the years into a rectangular stadium capable of holding 15,000 with a single tier grandstand built in 1960 that held approximately 2,000 while 6 light towers for night games (plus another 8 smaller light towers on the grandstand roof) were installed during the mid-1970s. Other than the grandstand, the ground was all terracing surrounding the playing surface. This changed in 1996 when seats were installed on the eastern side of the ground.","strStadiumLocation":"Adelaide","intStadiumCapacity":"17000","strWebsite":"www.adelaideunited.com.au","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Adelaide United FC is a professional soccer club based in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.

The stadium is home to the Central Coast Mariners association football club which compete in the A-League. The stadium also hosts rugby league and rugby union fixtures on an ad hoc basis as well as other major social events.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was originally designed to be the home stadium for the North Sydney Bears rugby league football club.\r\n\r\nThe stadium is rectangular and is unusual in that seating is located on only three sides of the ground. The southern end is open giving filtered views of Brisbane Water through a row of palm trees. With an all seater capacity of 20,059 it was as of 2012 the second smallest stadium in the A-League. It is within walking distance of the Gosford CBD and Gosford railway station. The Central Coast Leagues Club and League Club Field are adjacent to the stadium, across Dane Drive.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, Erina Shire Council proposed to create a park on the shore of Brisbane Water. The park required much land to be reclaimed from marshland. It also required privately owned land to be purchased by council and a section of road to be demolished. Waterside Park was opened in 1915 and a cricket pitch was added during that year. Further reclamation of the foreshore extended the park during the Depression that gave work to the unemployed. By 1939 surplus railway land had been added and a Bowling Club and green as well as tennis courts had been constructed. In 1939 the Park was renamed Grahame Park, after the then mayor of Gosford, William Calman Grahame.\r\n\r\nA full stadium was then touted and later built in the late 1990s, planned to be ready in 1999 for NRL club the North Sydney Bears, before construction problems including large spells of inclement weather delayed completion. The stadium finally opened in early 2000 as NorthPower Stadium at Grahame Park, the Northern Eagles National Rugby League team (a merging of the aforementioned Bears and the Manly Sea Eagles) taking residence there until their dissolving at the conclusion of the 2002 season. In 2003, with no major sporting team in residence, the stadium played host to three group matches in the 2003 Rugby World Cup. The Pacific Islanders rugby union team played one match at the stadium on their 2004 tour. The stadium gained its second full-time tenant in 2005 with the formation of the Central Coast Mariners, a team in the newly formed national A-League soccer competition. It became the first full-time national sporting competition to have a team play at the stadium. Further use of the stadium in 2006 follows from it being the home ground to the Central Coast Waves rugby union team, which joined the Shute Shield in 2006. The stadium continues to host NRL competition matches from time to time, as well as a number of pre-season trials. The Central Coast Rays, the Central Coasts' Australian Rugby Championship team, played out of the stadium during the only season of the competition in 2007. The stadium continued as a home to the Mariners A-League side as of 2007, and hosted NRL matches throughout the 2008 Centenary Year.","strStadiumLocation":"Central Coast Stadium","intStadiumCapacity":"20059","strWebsite":"www.ccmariners.com.au","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Central Coast Mariners FC is an Australian professional soccer club based on the Central Coast of New South Wales.

These were all of oval configuration and best suited to Australian rules football or cricket. The largest rectangular stadium in the city, Olympic Park, was a repurposed track and field venue. Referred to as Melbourne Rectangular Stadium during its construction, the ground was officially named AAMI Park on 16 March 2010, in an eight-year sponsorship deal with insurance firm AAMI. The stadium is one of five stadiums of 2015 AFC Asian Cup, hosting the opening match and six other matches including one Quarter-final game.","strStadiumLocation":"Olympic Boulevard, inner Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","intStadiumCapacity":"30050","strWebsite":"www.melbournecityfc.com.au","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Melbourne City FC is an Australian professional soccer club based in Melbourne, Victoria.

This stadium had seated areas only on the wings, with standing-room sandy terraces on the north and south ends. The average crowd during the first year was 14,158.\r\n\r\nOn 2 September 2006, Melbourne Victory played Sydney FC at the 56,000 capacity Docklands Stadium. The match was a runaway success in terms of crowds, with 39,730 in attendance. As a result the club moved all but one of their home games to the ground.\r\n\r\nThis move to such a large stadium was viewed with scepticism by many, but proved to be an outstanding success, with the Grand Final held there. The average attendance rose to 27,728 for the 2006–07 season, 10,000 above the next highest in the A-League.\r\n\r\nPrior to the 2006–07 season the club had planned to move to a new $190 million stadium being built to the east of the current Olympic Park complex. The new stadium was originally expected to sit approximately 20,000 spectators (expandable to 25,000) and was to be completed by 2009.\r\n\r\nThese plans were revised after the Victory refused to commit to playing at such a small capacity stadium. On 23 May 2007, the club announced it had signed as a founding co-tenant of the new stadium, which would now be built to accommodate a maximum of 30,050 spectators with further renovations to 50,000 possible. However, further expansion in the near-term is unlikely as it was discovered during Australia's World Cup Bid process that to build such an expansion would be prohibitively expensive.\r\n\r\nDocklands Stadium continued to serve as the club's only home ground until the completion of AAMI Park. The club split its home games between the new stadium and Etihad Stadium from the 2010–11 A-League campaign onwards; the games of less importance or potential drawing power at the new stadium and the 'blockbusters' and finals matches at Etihad Stadium.\r\n\r\nOn 15 February 2014, Melbourne Victory played their Asian Champions League qualifying game against Muangthong United at Kardinia Park in Geelong due to AAMI Park and Etihad Stadium being unavailable.","strStadiumLocation":"Harbour Esplanade, Melbourne Docklands & Edwin Flack Field, Olympic Boulevard, Inner Melbourne","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"www.melbournevictory.com.au","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/gomvfc","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/gomvfc","strInstagram":"instagram.com\/gomvfc","strDescriptionEN":"Melbourne Victory FC is a professional soccer club based in Melbourne, Victoria.

The ground is home to the Newcastle Knights (National Rugby League) and Newcastle Jets FC (A-League). It is owned by the New South Wales government and administered by the Hunter Region Sporting Venues Authority. Due to past sponsorship deals, the ground has been previously known as Marathon Stadium, EnergyAustralia Stadium and Ausgrid Stadium. Newcastle International Sports Centre is also known as Newcastle Stadium when in use during AFC competitions due to conflicting sponsorship reasons.\r\nWork began on the stadium on 1 December 1967, and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 10 April 1970. It was originally known as the International Sports Centre, and is still part of the ISC complex to this day. The playing surface back then was originally oval shaped to allow both codes of rugby, soccer and cricket to be able to make use of it.\r\n\r\nThe Knights secured a lease on the stadium in 1986, and converted it from an oval to a rectangle layout. During the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour, the Newcastle Knights, in their first season, hosted a match at the ground.\r\n\r\nIn 1992, local tyre outlet Marathon Tyres became the naming rights sponsor for the stadium, and it was renamed Marathon Stadium. Towards the end of 2001, energy supplier EnergyAustralia took over naming rights, and thus the stadium became EnergyAustralia Stadium. In February 2011 it was announced that the stadium would be renamed to \"Ausgrid Stadium\" after EnergyAustralia was renamed \"Ausgrid\".\r\n\r\nBefore redevelopment, the stadium had a capacity of 28,000, including 5,000 in the main grandstand. The ground attendance record for a sporting event is 32,642, which was set when the Knights took on the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in July 1995. Despite a lack of incidents, police subsequently asked for the allowed capacity to be lowered for reasons of safety.\r\n\r\nFollowing the retirement of former Knights captain Andrew Johns, the new eastern grandstand was renamed The Andrew Johns Stand in honour of Johns in front of a packed crowd before the Knights vs Brisbane Broncos NRL match on Sunday 22 April 2007.\r\n\r\nThe name (Newcastle International Sports Centre) is used primarily by those who wish to mention stadiums by original names, such as non-commercial organisations like the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and those with other corporate interests such as FIFA or the Asian Football Confederation.","strStadiumLocation":"New Lambton, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia","intStadiumCapacity":"33000","strWebsite":"www.newcastlejets.com.au","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Newcastle United Jets FC, commonly known as Newcastle Jets, is an Australian professional soccer club based in Newcastle, New South Wales.

The land on which the stadium was built was made a public reserve in 1904, with the main ground developed several years later. Perth Oval was the home ground of the East Perth Football Club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) from 1910 until 2002, and hosted several of the competition's grand finals during that time. In 2004, the ground was redeveloped, altering it from an oval field to a rectangular field. The ground is currently home to two major professional sporting clubs: Perth Glory FC, an Association football team competing in the A-League, and the Western Force, a rugby union team competing in the Super Rugby competition.

The club competed in the 1994 Singapore Premier League along with the Darwin Cubs. At the time, there were visions of establishing an Asia-Pacific Super League which could become a sporting and financial empire in the east. It turned out to be something of a farce. The Kangaroos finished the league season undefeated and easily won the Singapore league title.
