It was founded on 12 April 1953, as a club affiliated with the East German police, and became one of the most popular and successful clubs in East German football, winning eight league titles. After the reunification of Germany, Dynamo played four seasons in the top division Bundesliga (1991–95), but have since drifted between the second and fourth tiers. The club currently plays in the 2. Bundesliga.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nEarly years (1950–1954)\r\n\r\nHistorical chart of Dynamo Dresden league performance\r\nThe city of Dresden had played a significant part in German football before and during World War II with local club Dresdner SC earning national championships in 1943 and 1944. After the war the occupying Allied authorities dissolved organizations across the country, including sports and football clubs like SC, as part of the process of denazification. DSC was reestablished in 1946 as SG Friedrichstadt, but with the eastern part of the country, including Dresden, under Soviet control, authorities considered the club to be too bourgeois. After a riot at the final of the 1950 East German championship, the club was dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe city needed a new, ideologically safe representative, and a new football club as founded, as part of SG Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden. A team was assembled with players delegated from 11 other police-affiliated clubs, and quickly established itself as a force in East German football, winning its first cup in 1952. In April 1953, the central sports society SV Dynamo was founded, to which VP Dresden were affiliated, taking the name of SG Dynamo Dresden. Shortly after this the club claimed its first East German title.\r\n\r\nThis success, though, proved to be the club's undoing. Erich Mielke, head of the Stasi, of which Dynamo were now part, was unhappy that Dresden was enjoying footballing success, while the capital, East Berlin, lacked a strong footballing team. In 1954, Dynamo's team were moved to Berlin, to form Dynamo Berlin. Among the players lost to Berlin were Dynamo's first internationals, including Johannes Matzen, Herbert Schoen and Günter Schröter, while the remainder of the club was left to regroup in the second-tier DDR-Liga.\r\n\r\nRe-emergence (1954–1969)\r\nDynamo Dresden were left with a team composed of youth and reserve players, and by 1957 had dropped to the fourth tier, playing in the local Bezirksliga. They began to climb the leagues, though, and by 1962 they were back in the DDR-Oberliga, and although this first season ended in relegation, they bounced back immediately. They recovered equally well from another relegation in 1968, and remained in the Oberliga from 1969 until its dissolution in 1991. This relegation came after a fourth-place finish in 1967, which enabled Dynamo's first foray into European football – they entered the 1967–68 Fairs Cup, where they were eliminated by Scottish side Rangers in the first round.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1965–66 season, 11 East German clubs were separated from their parent sports clubs to be designated as Fußballclubs: clubs focused entirely on football, where the country's best talent would be transferred with the object of developing players for the national team. Dynamo Dresden were one of these, although they retained the title of Sportgemeinschaft (SG).","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Germany","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/yxqvxp1471898795.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/uyuyrr1475396711.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/dynamodresden","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"138427","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"4262","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Eichstätt","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"VfB Eichstätt, VfB Eichstaett","intFormedYear":"1920","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"German Regionalliga Bayern","idLeague":"4748","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Liqui-Moly-Stadion","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"Eichstätt, Bavaria","intStadiumCapacity":"2090","strWebsite":"www.vfb-eichstaett.de","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/VfB-Eichst%C3%A4tt-159991927401973\/","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/vfbeichstaett","strDescriptionEN":"The VfB Eichstätt is a German association football club from the town of Eichstätt, Bavaria.

The team won the first Bundesliga in 1963.\r\n\r\nThe club's nickname Die Geißböcke (The Billy Goats) refers to the club's mascot, a male goat named Hennes after the veteran FC player and (later) manager Hennes Weisweiler. The first Hennes was donated by a circus entrepreneur as a Cologne carnival joke. The current mascot is Hennes IX as of 1 August 2019 after Hennex VIII was retired by the club due to old age. Another nickname for the club, more common locally due to its ambiguity, is FC (often written as Effzeh), a common German abbreviation for football clubs. Characteristic for the dialect spoken around Cologne, this is pronounced \"EF-tsay\", in contrast to the Standard German pronunciation of the abbreviation where the second syllable is emphasized (). Köln play at home in white and red, both colours having been used as the main shirt colour throughout its history.\r\n\r\nLike many of Germany's other professional football clubs, 1.

The club currently plays in the 2. Bundesliga, the second tier of the German football league system. Founded in 1895, it entered the league in 1913 and were a fixture in top-flight play from the early 1920s up to the foundation of the nationwide Bundesliga in 1963 in which they participated in 23 seasons between 1966 and 2013.\r\n\r\nThe earliest roots of the association go back to the establishment of the gymnastics club Turnverein Flingern on 5 May 1895 in the village of Flingern, today one of the eastern quarters of Düsseldorf. Two other sides figure in the club's early history: Düsseldorfer Fußballklub Spielverein, founded in 1908, and FK Alemania 1911, which was founded in 1911 and became Fortuna 1911 the following year. In mid-1913, these two clubs merged to form Düsseldorfer Fußball-Club Fortuna 1911 which played its debut season in the Westdeutschen Spielverband in 1913–14. TV Flingern joined Fortuna to create Düsseldorfer Turn- und Sportverein Fortuna on 15 November 1919.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1920s, Fortuna won its first honours as a first tier side; it captured a district level Bezirksliga title in 1927, sent its first representative to the Germany national team in 1928 (Ernst Albrecht), and took a second Bezirksliga title in 1929. The team continued to perform well into the 1930s, winning its third and fourth district titles en route to a Western German football championship in 1931 and its greatest success, a German football championship in 1933 against Schalke 04, which was on the verge of becoming the era's dominant side in Germany. Fortuna was the first team to win the title without conceding a goal in the final rounds of the tournament. It beat Vorwärts-Rasensport Gleiwitz (9–0), Arminia Hannover (3–0), Eintracht Frankfurt (4–0) and finally Schalke 04 (3–0) en route to becoming the first national champion from the industrial Rhine-Ruhr area.\r\n\r\nIn the following season, the club began playing in Gauliga Niederrhein, 1 of 16 top-flight divisions formed in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich. Düsseldorf dominated the division through the 1930s as five-time champions between 1936 and 1940, and made losing appearances in the national championship final in 1936 (1–2 to 1. FC Nürnberg) and the final of the Tschammerpokal, the predecessor of today's DFB-Pokal, in 1937 (1–2 against Schalke 04). The club was relegated in 1942 but made a prompt return to the top flight the following season.

Although the current HSV was founded in June 1919 from a merger of three earlier clubs, it officially traces its origin to 29 September 1887 when the first of the predecessors, SC Germania, was founded. HSV's football team has the unique distinction of having played continuously in the top tier of the German football league system since the end of World War I. It is the only team that has played in every season of the Bundesliga since its foundation in 1963, at which time the team was led by German national captain Uwe Seeler.\r\n\r\nHSV has won the German national championship six times, the DFB-Pokal three times and the League Cup twice. The team's most successful period was from the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s when, in addition to several domestic honours, they won the 1976–77 European Cup Winners' Cup and the 1982–83 European Cup. Their outstanding player was German national star Felix Magath. To date, HSV's last major trophy was the 1986–87 DFB-Pokal.\r\n\r\nHSV play their home games at the Volksparkstadion in Bahrenfeld, a western district of Hamburg. The club colours are officially blue, white and black but the home kit of the team is white jerseys and red shorts. The team's most common nickname is \"die Rothosen\" (the Red Shorts). As it is one of Germany's oldest clubs, it is also known as der Dinosaurier (the Dinosaur). HSV have rivalries with Werder Bremen, with whom they contest the Nordderby, and Hamburg-based FC St. Pauli, whom they contest the Hamburg derby.\r\n\r\nHSV is notable in football as a grassroots organisation with youth development a strong theme. The club had a team in the Women's Bundesliga from 2003 to 2012 but it was demoted to Regionalliga level because of financial problems. Other club departments include badminton, baseball, basketball, bowling, boxing, cricket, darts, hockey, golf, gymnastics, handball and cardiopulmonary rehabilitation exercises. These departments represent about ten percent of the club membership. HSV is one of the biggest sports clubs in Germany with over 70,000 members in all its departments and stated by Forbes to be among the twenty largest football clubs in the world.","strDescriptionDE":"Der Hamburger Sport-Verein e.V., kurz Hamburger SV oder einfach nur HSV, ist ein Sportverein aus der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg.

In addition, the stadium has hosted numerous international matches, 4 (old) league championship games (1955,57,58,61), 2 DFB Supercup finals (1991–92) and 8 DFB Cup finals (1962, 63, 65, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79).\r\n\r\nFrom 2002 to 2013 the stadium carried the name of sponsor AWD.\r\n\r\nOn 17 November 2015, the stadium was due to host an international friendly between Germany and the Netherlands. However, the match was postponed two hours before kick off following reports of a \"concrete security threat\" and \"intention to ignite explosives\". The stadium and surrounding areas were evacuated, though no explosives were found.","strStadiumLocation":"Hanover, Germany","intStadiumCapacity":"49000","strWebsite":"www.hannover96.de\/CDA\/index.php?id=7767","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/Hannover96\/posts\/10156417430202101","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/Hannover96","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/hannover96","strDescriptionEN":"Hannoverscher Sportverein von 1896, commonly referred to as Hannover 96 , Hannover, HSV (although this may cause confusion with Hamburger SV) or simply 96, is a German association football club based in the city of Hanover, Lower Saxony. Hannover 96 play in the Bundesliga, the top tier in the German football league system.\r\n\r\nHannover 96 was founded in 1896. Hannover have won two German championships and one DFB-Pokal. Hannover's stadium is the HDI-Arena. Hannover 96 has a big rivalry with VfL Wolfsburg and Eintracht Braunschweig.\r\n\r\nHannover 96 was founded on 12 April 1896 as Hannoverscher Fußball-Club 1896, upon the suggestion of Ferdinand-Wilhelm Fricke, founder of the Deutscher FV 1878 Hannover. Their initial enthusiasm was for athletics and rugby; football did not become their primary interest until 1899. Most of the membership of Germania 1902 Hannover became part of 96 in 1902, while others of the club formed Hannoverscher Ballspielverein. In 1913, they merged with Ballverein 1898 Hannovera (formed in the 1905 merger of Fußballverein Hannovera 1898 Hannover and Hannoverscher BV) to become Hannoverscher Sportverein 1896. Hannoverscher FC's colours were black-white-green, but they played in blue, while BV played in red. The newly united team kept black-white-green as the club colours, but they chose to take to the field in red, giving the team the nickname Die Roten (en: The Reds). The team's third jersey is in the club's official colours. The club made regular appearances in the national playoffs through the early 1900s, but were unable to progress past Eintracht Braunschweig, planting the seeds of a rivalry that has survived to this day. HSV continued to field strong sides and make national level appearances on into the 1920s. Under the Third Reich, German football was re-organized into 16 top-flight leagues in 1933 and Hannover became part of the Gauliga Niedersachsen. They appeared in the country's final rounds in 1935 and sent representatives to the national side the next year. They won their first national championship in 1938 in what was one of the biggest upsets in German football history when they beat Schalke 04, the most dominant side in the country in the era. The two sides played to a 3:3 draw before Hannover prevailed 4:3 in a tension filled re-match. In 1942, the team moved to the newly formed Gauliga Braunschweig-Südhannover.\r\nHannover 96 play in the 2. Bundesliga, the second tier in the German football league system, having been relegated from the Bundesliga, Germany's first tier, after finishing 17th in the 2018–19 season.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Germany","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/tqpqqv1473454148.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/vtpxuv1475396747.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/tv6c881543487691.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/sxxsvs1420508001.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/yr7xrh1543487260.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/h783lk1543487271.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/ihkqoe1543487279.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/qc8jg01543490611.jpg","strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"138356","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"9341","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Hannover II","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Hannover 96 II, Hanover 96 II, Hanover II","intFormedYear":"0","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"German Regionalliga Nord","idLeague":"4695","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Eilenriedestadion","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"The Eilenriedestadion (also known as the 96-Stadion) is a football stadium in Hanover, Germany.

Hertha BSC plays in the Bundesliga, the top-tier of German football, after finishing first in the 2. Bundesliga in 2013.\r\n\r\nHertha BSC was founded in 1892, and was a founding member of the German Football Association in Leipzig in 1900. The team won the German championship in 1930 and 1931. Since 1963, Hertha's stadium has been the Olympiastadion. The club is known as Die Alte Dame in German, which translates to \"The Old Lady\". In 2002, the sports activities of the professional, amateur, and under-19 teams were separated into Hertha BSC GmbH & Co. KGaA.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nEarly years\r\nThe club was formed in 1892 as BFC Hertha 92, taking its name from a steamship with a blue and white smokestack; one of the four young men who founded the club had taken a day trip on this ship with his father. The name Hertha is a variation on Nerthus referring to fertility goddess from Germanic mythology.\r\n\r\nHertha performed consistently well on the field, including a win in the first Berlin championship final in 1905. In May 1910, Hertha won a friendly match against Southend United, which was considered significant at the time, as England was where the game originated and English clubs dominated the sport. However, their on-field success was not matched financially and in 1920 the staunchly working-class Hertha merged with the well-heeled club Berliner Sport-Club to form Hertha Berliner Sport-Club. The new team continued to enjoy considerable success in the Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg, while also enduring a substantial measure of frustration. The team played its way to the German championship final in six consecutive seasons from 1926 to 1931, but was only able to win the title in 1930 and 1931 with BSC leaving to become an independent club again after the combined side's first championship. Notwithstanding, Hertha emerged as the Germany's second most successful team during the inter-war years.\r\n\r\nPlay under the Third Reich\r\nGerman football was re-organized under the Third Reich in 1933 into 16 top-flight divisions, which saw Hertha playing in the Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg. The club continued to enjoy success within their division, regularly finishing in the upper half of the table and capturing the divisional title in 1935, 1937 and 1944. It faded from prominence, however, unable to advance out of the early rounds of the national championship rounds. Politically, the club was overhauled under Hitler, with Hans Pfeifer, a Nazi party member, being installed as president.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Germany","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/qpsryu1473453350.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133658-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/rssuvv1420480604.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/ywxxwx1424315376.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/tqstsy1454144518.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wtsvxx1454144429.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/twspqs1454144153.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/wptpuu1454144126.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/herthatv","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"138358","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"9353","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Hertha II","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Hertha BSC II, Hertha Berlin II","intFormedYear":"0","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"German Regionalliga Nordost","idLeague":"4749","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Amateurstadion","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"Berlin, Germany","intStadiumCapacity":"4300","strWebsite":"www.herthabsc.de\/nachwuchs\/nachwuchsteams\/u23\/spielplan-tabelle\/page\/1323-4225---.html","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"Hertha BSC II is the reserve team of Hertha BSC that is based in Berlin, Germany.

A fifth division side in 2000, the club made a remarkable advance to the German football league system top tier Bundesliga in 2008 with the financial backing of alumnus and software mogul Dietmar Hopp.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nThe modern-day club was formed in 1945, when gymnastics club Turnverein Hoffenheim (founded 1 July 1899) and football club Fußballverein Hoffenheim (founded 1921) merged. At the beginning of the 1990s, the club was an obscure local amateur side playing in the eighth division Baden-Württemberg A-Liga. They steadily improved and by 1996 were competing in the Verbandsliga Nordbaden (V).\r\n\r\nAround 2000, alumnus Dietmar Hopp returned to the club of his youth as a financial backer. Hopp was the co-founder of software firm SAP and he put some of his money into the club. His contributions generated almost immediate results: in 2000 Hoffenheim finished first in the Verbandsliga and was promoted to the fourth-division Oberliga Baden-Württemberg. Another first-place finish moved the club up to the Regionalliga Süd (III) for the 2001–02 season. They finished 13th in their first season in the Regionalliga, but improved significantly the next year, earning a fifth-place result.\r\n\r\nHoffenheim earned fifth and seventh-place finishes in the next two seasons, before improving to fourth in 2005–06 to earn their best result to date. The club made its first DFB-Pokal appearance in the 2003–04 competition and performed well, advancing to the quarter-finals by eliminating 2. Bundesliga sides Eintracht Trier and Karlsruher SC and Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen before being put out themselves by another 2. Bundesliga side, VfB Lübeck.\r\n\r\nNegotiations to merge TSG Hoffenheim, Astoria Walldorf, and SV Sandhausen to create FC Heidelberg 06 in 2005 were abandoned due to the resistance of the latter two clubs, and the failure to agree on whether the new side's stadium should be located in Heidelberg or Eppelheim. Team owner Hopp clearly preferred Heidelberg, but could not overcome the resistance of local firm Wild, which had already reserved the site of the planned stadium for its new production facilities.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Germany","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/qusuxu1473453358.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133657-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/bhwri31543832431.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/sxsvvv1424536655.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/9xpyfc1543771558.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/ir034c1543771566.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/8cd0v91543771574.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/ckcy8c1543773284.jpg","strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"138365","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"9364","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Hoffenheim II","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"TSG 1899 Hoffenheim II","intFormedYear":"0","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"German Regionalliga SudWest","idLeague":"4747","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Dietmar-Hopp-Stadion","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"The Dietmar-Hopp-Stadion is a football ground in Hoffenheim, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

However, the city, Bayer Leverkusen, and the German organizing committee soon agreed that expanding BayArena to the FIFA-mandated minimum 40,000 capacity for World Cup matches would not be practical, and the city withdrew its bid. Instead, it was agreed that BayArena would be the main training facility for the German national team during the 2006 finals. Jürgen Klinsmann, former national coach, however decided against Leverkusen and opted for Berlin as the main training facility.

The First World War halted the progress of both the stadium and FC Borussia, but by late 1917 the team had begun to play games once more. In 1919, FC Borussia merged with another local club, Turnverein Germania 1889, becoming 1899 VfTuR M.Gladbach. The club tasted its first major success in 1920, beating Kölner BC 3–1, thus winning the Westdeutsche Meisterschaft final.\r\n\r\nThe union between Germania and Borussia only lasted a matter of two years; the club was thereafter known as Borussia VfL 1900 e.V.

Fußball- und Sportverein Mainz 05 e. V., usually shortened to 1. FSV Mainz 05, Mainz 05  or simply Mainz, is a German association football club, founded in 1905 and based in Mainz, Rhineland-Palatinate. 1. FSV Mainz 05 have played in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system, for eight consecutive years, starting with the 2009–10 season. The club's main local rivals are Eintracht Frankfurt and 1. FC Kaiserslautern. In addition to the football division, 1. FSV Mainz 05 have handball and table tennis departments.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nEarly years\r\nA failed attempt to start a football club in the city in 1903 was followed up two years later by the successful creation of 1. Mainzer Fussballclub Hassia 1905. After a number of years of play in the Süddeutschen Fußballverband (South German Football League), the club merged with FC Hermannia 07 – the former football side of Mainzer TV 1817 – to form 1. Mainzer Fussballverein Hassia 05, which dropped \"Hassia\" from its name in August 1912. Another merger after World War I, in 1919, with Sportverein 1908 Mainz, resulted in the formation of 1. Mainzer Fußball- und Sportverein 05. Die Nullfünfer were a solid club that earned several regional league championships in the period between the wars and qualified for the opening round of the national championships in 1921, after winning the Kreisliga Hessen.\r\n\r\nPlay during the Nazi era\r\nIn the late 1920s and early 1930s, the club earned decent results in the Bezirksliga Main-Hessen – Gruppe Hessen, including first-place finishes in 1932 and 1933. This merited the team a place in the Gauliga Südwest, 1 of 16 new first division leagues formed in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich. Unfortunately, the club only managed a single season at that level before being relegated, due to the high intensity play that they were unable to keep up with. Karl Scherm scored in 23 out of 44 matches with Mainz during his last season. In 1938, Mainz was forced into a merger with Reichsbahn SV Mainz and played as Reichsbahn SV Mainz 05 until the end of World War II.\r\n\r\nLong march to the Bundesliga\r\n\r\nHistorical chart of 1. FSV Mainz league performance after WWII\r\nAfter World War II, the club again joined the upper ranks of league play in Germany's Oberliga Südwest, but were never better than a mid-table side. It played in the top flight until the founding of the new professional league, the Bundesliga, in 1963 and would go on to play as a second division side for most of the next four decades. They withdrew for a time – from the late 1970s into the late 1980s – to the Amateur Oberliga Südwest (III), as the result of a series of financial problems. Mainz earned honours as the German amateur champions in 1982.\r\n\r\nThe club returned to professional play with promotion to the 2. Bundesliga for a single season in 1988–89 with Bodo Hertlein as president, before finally returning for an extended run in 1990–91. Initially, they were perennial relegation candidates, struggling hard each season to avoid being sent down. However, under unorthodox trainer Wolfgang Frank, Mainz became one of the first clubs in German soccer to adopt a flat four zone defence, as opposed to the then-popular man-to-man defense using a libero.\r\n\r\nMainz failed in three attempts to make it to the top flight in 1996–97, 2001–02, and 2002–03, with close fourth-place finishes just out of the promotion zone. The last failed attempt stung as they were denied promotion in the 93rd minute of the last match of the season. One year earlier, Mainz became the best non-promoted team of all-time in the 2. Bundesliga with 64 points accumulated. However, the club's persistence paid dividends after promotion to the Bundesliga in 2003–04 under head coach Jürgen Klopp. The club played three seasons in the top flight but were relegated at the end of the 2006–07 season. Mainz then secured promotion back to the top flight just two years later, after the 2008–09 season.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormer logo\r\nMainz also earned a spot in the 2005–06 UEFA Cup in their debut Bundesliga season as Germany's nominee in the Fair Play draw which acknowledges positive play, respect for one's opponent, respect for the referee, the behaviour of the crowd and of team officials, as well as cautions and dismissals. Due to the Bruchweg stadium's limited capacity, the home matches in UEFA Cup were played in Frankfurt's Commerzbank-Arena. After defeating Armenian club Mika and Icelandic club Keflavík in the qualifying rounds, Mainz lost to eventual champions Sevilla 2–0 on aggregate in the first round.\r\n\r\nIn the 2010–11 season, Mainz equalled the Bundesliga starting record by winning their first seven matches that season. They ended the season with their best finish to date in fifth place, good enough to secure them their second entry to the UEFA Europa League, where they were eliminated in the third qualifying round by Romanian club Gaz Metan Mediaș.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Germany","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/fhm9v51552134916.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/yvyptv1474197215.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/dj769c1543926175.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/uyrxwt1424537020.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/c72e0j1542879905.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/cmrwjx1542879944.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/spwyqv1424537590.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/x4p7w01543773766.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCMT1hwsDgOEMhS2dIfD3e6A","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"138364","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"1331","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Mainz II","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"1.

FCN oder Der Club), ist ein traditionsreicher deutscher Fußballverein aus Nürnberg, der am 4. Mai 1900 gegründet wurde. Die Vereinsfarben sind Rot und Weiß, die Traditionsfarben dagegen Weinrot und Schwarz, in denen er seit der Saison 2007\/08 auch wieder aufläuft. Der Verein hat etwa 15.000 Mitglieder.[1]\r\n\r\nBis 1995 war der 1. FC Nürnberg auch ein Sportverein. Seitdem ist die Herren-Fußballabteilung ein eigenständiger Verein unter dem alten Namen 1. FC Nürnberg VfL e. V., der dem 1. FCN Dachverein e. V. angehört. Auch die anderen Vereinsabteilungen wurden selbstständige Vereine, die im Dachverein organisiert sind und sich für den Bezug auf den 1. FC Nürnberg neue Vereinsnamen zulegen mussten: Box-Club 1. FC Nürnberg, 1. FC Nürnberg Frauen- und Mädchenfußball, 1. FC Nürnberg Handball 2009, Schach, Hockey, 1. FCN Roll- und Eissport, 1. FCN Schwimmen, 1. FCN Ski und Tennis-Club 1. FC Nürnberg. Zu den erfolgreichsten Mannschaften gehören die Handballfrauen mit zwölf deutschen Meisterschaften, zwei Pokalsiegen und einem Europapokalsieg, die jedoch 2009 insolvent gingen und seither nur noch in der Bayernliga spielen. Am bekanntesten ist jedoch der Fußballverein mit über 11.500 Mitgliedern und insbesondere die Profimannschaft. In der Vergangenheit bestand zudem eine erfolgreiche Leichtathletikabteilung.\r\n\r\nMit neun Meisterschaften war der Club bis 1987 über 60 Jahre lang deutscher Fußball-Rekordmeister, bevor ihn der FC Bayern München ablöste. Seitdem ist der FCN als „Fahrstuhlmannschaft“ bekannt: Es gelingt dem Verein nicht, sich dauerhaft in einer Liga zu etablieren, sondern er steigt wiederholt ab und auf. Von 2009 bis 2014 spielte der 1. FC Nürnberg wieder in der 1. Bundesliga. In der ewigen Tabelle belegt der Verein den 14. Platz.\r\n\r\nDie Fußball-Heimspiele werden im vormaligen Frankenstadion ausgetragen, das jetzt Grundig Stadion heißt. Es fasst 50.000 Zuschauer. Das Trainingsgelände befindet sich rund einen Kilometer vom Stadion entfernt am Valznerweiher im Nürnberger Stadtteil Zerzabelshof.","strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":"El 1.

It is the largest football stadium in the former East Germany and has also hosted music concerts as well as football.\r\n\r\nIt is currently the home stadium for first-division club RB Leipzig but various Leipzig football teams have used the stadium as a home stadium, including VfB Leipzig (precursor to 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig) at various points in the 20th century (including large-scale European matches in the 1970s and domestic football in the 1990s).\r\n\r\nDue to UEFA sponsorship regulations, the stadium is known as the RB Arena for European matches.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nMain article: Zentralstadion (1956)\r\nIn 1956, the first Zentralstadion opened, at the time it was one of the biggest stadiums in Europe being able to hold 100,000 spectators. However, over the years it fell into disuse and was costing the city too much to maintain. In 1997, the city of Leipzig decided to build a new stadium within the old stadium, a modern state of the art stadium only for football. The new stadium was built from December 2000 till March 2004. A similar endeavor of constructing a new stadium within the confines of an historic stadium's exterior was completed in Chicago's Soldier Field, which similarly build a modern stadium while preserving the exterior of the original structure.\r\n\r\nThe Zentralstadion was the only stadium in the former East Germany to host games in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. It hosted four group matches and a round of 16 game in the tournament. A year earlier, it was also one of the venues for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and hosted three matches of the tournament, including the third-place match. From 2005 to 2007, the Zentralstadion was host of the German League Cup final.\r\n\r\nFC Sachsen Leipzig used the stadium as a home ground from time to time between 2004 and 2007, however they moved back to their traditional home, the Alfred-Kunze-Sportpark at the start of the 2008–09 season.\r\n\r\nIn July 2009, energy drink manufacturer Red Bull took over the license of SSV Markranstädt and renamed the team RasenBallsport Leipzig, in short RB Leipzig. From the outset, the new team outlined their wish to move into the tenant-less Zentralstadion and rename it the \"Red Bull Arena\". The naming rights were granted on 25 March 2010 and the stadium will be named so for a minimum period of 10 years as of 1 July 2010. The cost for renting the stadium will rise in accordance with the level of football RasenBallsport Leipzig are at. The team has pledged to upgrade the seating, install video advertising boards and make changes to the boxes and the VIP area.\r\n\r\nIn the 2010–11 season, Hallescher FC played between three and five games at the Zentralstadion due to their own Kurt-Wabbel Stadion being renovated.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the stadium was ranked 17th in the country based on attendance, safety, and number of events.\r\n\r\nFacilities\r\n\r\nRed Bull Arena with Festwiese\r\n\r\nLeipzig city centre with Red Bull Arena to the right\r\nThere are bridges built over the old stadium to connect with the new stadium. The roof has an integrated floodlight design and is designed to provide superior acoustics. The grass area is 120 x 80 m, the actual playing field is 105 x 68 m. It has been integrated into the area surrounding the stadium by large numbers of trees and other greenery.","strStadiumLocation":"Am Sportforum 3, Leipzig, Germany","intStadiumCapacity":"42959","strWebsite":"www.dierotenbullen.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/rbleipzig\/","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/dierotenbullen","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/dierotenbullen","strDescriptionEN":"RasenBallsport Leipzig e.V., commonly known as RB Leipzig, is a German association football club based in Leipzig, Saxony.

The \"04\" in the club's name derives from its formation in 1904.

V., commonly known as Werder Bremen, is a German sports club located in Bremen in the northwest German federal state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen. The club was founded in 1899 and has grown to 40,400 members. It is best known for its association football team.\r\n\r\nBremen's football club has been a mainstay in the Bundesliga, the top league of the German football league system. Bremen have won the Bundesliga championship four times and the DFB-Pokal six times. Their latest championship in each came in 2004, when they won a double. Bremen have also had European success, winning the 1992 European Cup Winners' Cup. Bremen also reached the final match of the last edition of the UEFA Cup in 2009 (it was rebranded the UEFA Europa League the following season), During the early 2000s, Bremen was one of the most successful teams in the Bundesliga, but the club has not played in a European competition since the 2010–2011 campaign.\r\n\r\nSince 1924, Werder Bremen's stadium is the Weserstadion. Werder Bremen's manager is Viktor Skrypnyk. Werder Bremen has a rivalry with Hamburger SV, another Bundesliga club in northern Germany, known as the Nordderby (English: North derby).\r\n\r\nThe club was founded on 4 February 1899 as Fußballverein Werder by a group of 16 vocational high school students who had won a prize of sports equipment. The students took the club's name from the seldom-used regional German word for “river peninsula\", which described the riverside field on which they played their first football games.\r\n\r\nThe predecessor to Bremen, known as SV Werder, played its first ever match on 10 September 1899 against ASC 1898 Bremen coming away with a 1–0 victory. In 1900 FV Bremen was represented at the founding of the German Football Association (DFB) at Leipzig. The club then enjoyed some early success, fielding competitive sides and winning a number of local championships. FV took part in the qualification play for the national championships in playoffs held by the Norddeutscher Fussball Verband (NFV), one of the seven major regional leagues after the turn of the century, but were unable to advance. They became the first club to charge spectators a fee to attend their games and to fence in their playing field.\r\n\r\nIn April 1914, the club became a department of Allgemeiner Bremer Turnverein 1860 and was briefly known as Sportabteilung Werder des ABTV. However, the relationship was short-lived and the club went its own way again less than two months later.\r\n\r\nSteady growth after World War I led the club to adopt other sports and, on 19 January 1920, change their name to the current Sportverein Werder Bremen. Football remained their primary interest, so much so that in 1922, they became the first German club to hire a professional coach. The team made regular appearances in year-end NFV qualification round play through the 1920s and on into the early 1930s, but did not enjoy any success.\r\n\r\nGerman football was re-organized under the Third Reich in 1933 into 16 first division leagues known as Gauligen and Werder became part of the Gauliga Niedersachsen. The club scored its first real successes, capturing division titles in 1934, 1936, and 1937, and took part for the first time in national level playoff competition. The shape of the Gauligen changed through the course of World War II and in 1939, the Gauliga Niedersachsen was split into two divisions. SV played in the Gauliga Niedersachsen\/Nord where they captured a fourth title in 1942. As the war overtook the country, the Gauligen became progressively more local in character. The Gauliga Niedersachsen\/Nord became the Gauliga Weser-Ems and then the Gauliga Weser-Ems\/Bremen over the next two years. Werder's 1944–45 season was cut short after just two matches.\r\n\r\nLike other organizations throughout Germany, the club was disbanded on the order of the occupying Allied authorities after the war. They re-constituted themselves 10 November 1945 as Turn- und Sportverein Werder 1945 Bremen, which was changed to Sport-Club Grün-Weiß 99 Bremen on 4 February 1946. The team took up play in the Stadtliga Bremen, and after capturing a title there, participated in the northern German championship round, advancing to the quarterfinals. They were able to reclaim the name SV Werder on 25 March 1946 before taking part in the playoffs.\r\n\r\nAt the time, professionals were not permitted to play in the German game, so it was normal for football players to take on other jobs, often with the club's local patron. In the case of Werder, a number of the players worked at the nearby Brinkmann tobacco factory, and so the side took on the nickname Texas 11 after one of the company's popular cigarette brands.\r\n\r\nBetween the end of the war and the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963 the club continued to do well, being recognized as one of the top two teams in northern Germany, along with Hamburger SV. In 1961, they managed their first DFB-Pokal win. Their performance was good enough to earn them a place as a charter member of the Bundesliga, and in the league's second season, Werder took the championship. They earned a second-place finish in the 1967–68, but then languished in the bottom half of the table for a dozen years. An attempt to improve their lot by signing high-priced talent earned the side the new, derisive nickname of the Millionaires and turned out to be an expensive failure. The club dropped out of the Bundesliga for the first and only time, being relegated to the 2nd Bundesliga-Nord for the 1980–81 season after a 17th place finish.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Germany","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/uurwqy1473453408.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133662-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/eyfwi71544617894.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wvysqt1424316088.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/vqttst1424316106.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/5rr36p1543487307.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/xq9y791543487334.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/7sjs071543772810.jpg","strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"138353","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"1330","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Werder Bremen II","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"SV Werder Bremen II","intFormedYear":"0","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"German Regionalliga Nord","idLeague":"4695","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Weserstadion Platz 11","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":"Weserstadion Platz 11 is a football stadium in Bremen, Germany.
