It is controlled by the ANFP, and its member of CONMEBOL. Their next major competition will be the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup where Chile qualified for the first time ever. They have been close to qualify in 1991, 1995 and 2011 and later finally made it in 2019. Chile is, along with Brazil the only teams who never missed a Copa América Femenina. Chile's friendlies are mostly with Argentina, who is a traditional rival. The team is coached by José Letelier and is captained by Christiane Endler.\r\n\r\nAs well as many South American nations, women's football is somewhat under shadow of men's football. Chile, for qualifying to the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France, marked itself as the fifth nation in the CONMEBOL to have both men's and women's teams qualify for senior FIFA tournaments.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Female","strCountry":"Chile","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/vc0pz71560081697.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
