It is nicknamed Vino Tinto (\"Red wine\") because of the traditional burgundy color of their shirts. When playing at home in official games, they usually rotate between three stadiums: The Polideportivo Cachamay in Puerto Ordaz, the Estadio José Antonio Anzoátegui in Puerto La Cruz and the Estadio Pueblo Nuevo in San Cristóbal. In friendly matches, they tend to rotate between the rest of the stadiums in the country.\r\n\r\nUnlike other South American nations, and akin to some Caribbean nations, baseball is extremely popular in Venezuela, which diverts athletic talent away from football, contributing to its historic lack of success in CONMEBOL competitions. As of 2018, they are the only CONMEBOL side to have never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. Often Venezuela would go through entire qualification tournaments without recording a single win, although this has changed in the last two qualifying rounds. Until 2011, their best finish in the Copa América was fifth in their first entry, in 1967. It is only recently with the spread of the World Cup's popularity in nations where football was not the primary sport (such as Japan, the United States, and Australia) that the national team found incentives to increase player development and fan support. As of November 2018, Venezuela has the highest position on the FIFA World Ranking of any team that has not yet qualified for the World Cup, being ranked 29th.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"International","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/v8r0ng1553419465.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"136742","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":null,"intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Venezuela  Basketball","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1938","strSport":"Basketball","strLeague":"FIBA Basketball World Cup","idLeague":"4549","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"The Venezuela national basketball team is organized and run by the Venezuelan Basketball Federation (FVB).
