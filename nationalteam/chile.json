It is the largest stadium in Chile with an official capacity of 48,665. It is part of a 62 hectare sporting complex which also features tennis courts, an aquatics center, a modern gymnasium, a velodrome, a BMX circuit, and an assistant ground\/warmup athletics track.\r\n\r\nConstruction began in February 1937 and the stadium was inaugurated on December 3, 1938. The architecture was based on the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany. The stadium was one of the venues for the FIFA World Cup in 1962, and hosted the final where Brazil defeated Czechoslovakia 3-1. It was notoriously used as a prison camp and torture facility by the military regime following the 1973 Chilean coup d'état.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, a complete modernization plan was unveiled for the stadium and surrounding facilities. President Michelle Bachelet said it would become the most modern stadium in South America.","strStadiumLocation":"Santiago","intStadiumCapacity":"48665","strWebsite":"www.anfp.cl","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"The Chile national football team represents Chile in all major international football competitions and is controlled by the Federación de Fútbol de Chile which was established in 1895. The team is commonly referred to as La Roja (\"The Red One\"). They have appeared in nine World Cup tournaments and were hosts of the 1962 FIFA World Cup where they finished in third place, the highest position the country has ever achieved in the World Cup. Since the mid to late 1960s, the Elo ratings ranks Chile among the 25 strongest football teams in the world.\r\n\r\nChile are known for being a consistently competitive international side, and are the reigning Copa América champions, having won the tournament for the first time on home soil in 2015. Prior to this, Chile had been runner-ups in the competition on four occasions. As a result of winning the 2015 Copa América, they qualified for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"International","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/rvxrxs1455463996.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/uspvsv1424078977.png","strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"136821","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"1977","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Chile Women","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Chile W","intFormedYear":"1991","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"FIFA Womens World Cup","idLeague":"4565","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"The Chile women's national football team represents Chile in international women's football. It is controlled by the ANFP, and its member of CONMEBOL. Their next major competition will be the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup where Chile qualified for the first time ever. They have been close to qualify in 1991, 1995 and 2011 and later finally made it in 2019. Chile is, along with Brazil the only teams who never missed a Copa América Femenina. Chile's friendlies are mostly with Argentina, who is a traditional rival. The team is coached by José Letelier and is captained by Christiane Endler.\r\n\r\nAs well as many South American nations, women's football is somewhat under shadow of men's football. Chile, for qualifying to the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France, marked itself as the fifth nation in the CONMEBOL to have both men's and women's teams qualify for senior FIFA tournaments.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Female","strCountry":"Chile","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/vc0pz71560081697.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"137357","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":null,"intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Chile Hockey Women","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":null,"intFormedYear":null,"strSport":"Field Hockey","strLeague":"Field Hockey Olympics Women","idLeague":"4586","strDivision":null,"strManager":null,"strStadium":null,"strKeywords":null,"strRSS":null,"strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":null,"intStadiumCapacity":null,"strWebsite":null,"strFacebook":null,"strTwitter":null,"strInstagram":null,"strDescriptionEN":null,"strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Chile\n\t\t\t\t\t\t","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/6j255j1572086415.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
