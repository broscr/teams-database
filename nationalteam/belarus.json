It was recently reopened after a massive renovation project. Earlier it was used mostly for football matches and was the home ground of Dinamo Minsk, FC Minsk and the Belarus national football team. Previously the stadium officially held 40,000, but because part of the upper stand had been abandoned in the mid-1990s for safety reasons, the actual capacity before renovations was only 34,000. After renovation the capacity is 22,246.","strStadiumLocation":"Minsk, Belarus","intStadiumCapacity":"22000","strWebsite":"abff.by\/index.php?lang=ru","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/BelFootFederation","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/BelFootFeder","strInstagram":"instagram.com\/belarus_football_team","strDescriptionEN":"Belarus national football team (Belarusian: Нацыянальная зборная Беларусі па футболе, Natsyyanalnaya zbornaya Bielarusi pa futbolie) represents Belarus in association football and is controlled by the Football Federation of Belarus, the governing body for football in Belarus.
