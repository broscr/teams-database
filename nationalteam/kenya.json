It was built in 1987 for the All-Africa Games held in Nairobi. The facilities include a 60,000 seat arena with a running track and a pitch used for football and rugby union, a competition size swimming pool, an indoor arena and a 108-bed capacity hotel.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was closed in January 2010 for renovation works worth Kes 900 million and funded by a grant to the Government of Kenya by the Government of China. Chinese firm, Sheng Li Engineering Construction Company Limited was contracted to conduct the renovations and the stadium was reopened in March 2012 after completion of the renovations.\r\n\r\nIn April and May 2014, after terror attacks in Nairobi and Mombasa, the main stadium was used as a screening center as part of 'Operation Usalama Watch' during which thousands of people were indiscriminately rounded up and arrested by the Kenyan Police, and were subjected to harassment, extortion and ill-treatment. Suspected illegal Somali immigrants were detained in the stadium under poor conditions with lack of access to food and legal assistance. For this purpose the stadium was officially designated on 17 April 2014 as a police station and detention centre.\r\n\r\nThe stadium located within the Sports Centre hosted the 2017 World U18 Championships in Athletics.","strStadiumLocation":"Kasarani, Nairobi, Kenya","intStadiumCapacity":"5000","strWebsite":"","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"The Kenya national football team represents Kenya in international football.
