Fiji also regularly plays test matches during the June and November test windows. Fiji also plays in the Pacific Tri-Nations, and has won the most Pacific Tri-Nations Championships of the three participating teams.\r\n\r\nFiji is one of the few countries where rugby union is the main sport. There are approximately 80,000 registered players from a total population of around 950,000. One of the problems for Fiji is simply getting their rugby players to play for Fiji as a country, as many have contracts in Europe or with Super Rugby teams where the money is far more rewarding. The repatriated salaries of its overseas stars have become an important part of some local economies.\r\n\r\nThe cibi (pronounced ) war dance is performed by the Fiji rugby team before each Test match. It has been used on the rugby field since 1939, though its origins date back to the country's warring times with its Pacific neighbours.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Fiji","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/i5j8lc1566382820.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"137390","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":null,"intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Fijian Drua","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Fijian Drua","intFormedYear":"2017","strSport":"Rugby","strLeague":"Australian National Rugby Championship","idLeague":"4417","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"The Fijian Drua is a rugby union team based in Fiji that competes in the Australian National Rugby Championship (NRC).
