Built in 2014 to host sporting and entertainment events, it replaced the former National Stadium on the recommendation of then Community Development and Sports Minister Abdullah Tarmugi in Parliament in 2001. His proposal was based on a Committee on Sporting Singapore report to promote a culture of sports in the city-state.\r\n\r\nIt is the first and largest sports facilities infrastructure Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) project in the world and Singapore's flagship PPP project of this nature. Following an Invitation to Tender by the then Singapore Sports Council in 2006, the consortium SportsHub Pte Ltd comprising four equity partners, InfraRed Capital Partners, Dragages Singapore, Cushman & Wakefield Facilities & Engineering, and Global Spectrum Asia, won the bid for the project on January 19, 2008. It was officially appointed on August 25, 2010 to design, build, finance and operate the Singapore Sports Hub for a period of 25 years.\r\n\r\nConstruction of the Singapore Sports Hub began with a ground-breaking ceremony on 29 September 2010, before the former arena there was demolished. Served primarily by the Stadium MRT station, it was completed in June 2014 and, among others, rolled out a new 55,000-seat National Stadium with the largest free-spanning retractable dome roof in the world, an aquatic centre, a multi-sport indoor arena, and a water sports facility. The Singapore Sports Hub, which incorporated an existing 12,000-seat Singapore Indoor Stadium, began operations on June 30, 2014 for the general public to start using its facilities. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong officially opened it 13 months later on July 26, 2015.","strStadiumLocation":"Kallang, Singapore","intStadiumCapacity":"3000","strWebsite":"","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"The Singapore Slingers are a professional basketball team that currently compete in the ASEAN Basketball League.
