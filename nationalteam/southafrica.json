South Africa's home ground is FNB Stadium, so named due to a naming rights deal, in Johannesburg. The team is currently under the charge of Stuart Baxter, who was appointed as coach on 5 April 2017. The team's greatest achievement was winning the Africa Cup of Nations at home in 1996.\r\n\r\nHaving played their first match in 1924, they returned to the world stage in 1992, after 16 years of being banned from FIFA, and 40 years of effective suspension due to the apartheid system. South Africa became the first African nation to host the FIFA World Cup when it was granted host status for the 2010 edition. The team's Siphiwe Tshabalala was also the first player to score in this World Cup during the opening game against Mexico, which was followed by an iconic Macarena-style goal celebration from five South African players. Despite defeating France 2–1 in their final game of the Group Stage, they failed to progress from the first round of the tournament, becoming the first host nation in the history of the FIFA World Cup to exit in the group stage. Despite this, the team ranked 20th out of 32 sides, ranking higher than 12 teams who qualified.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"International","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/xjz9j91553368824.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"136823","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"1978","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"South Africa Women","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"South Africa W","intFormedYear":"1993","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"FIFA Womens World Cup","idLeague":"4565","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"The South Africa national women's football team, nicknamed Banyana Banyana (The Girls), is the national team of South Africa and is controlled by the South African Football Association.\r\n\r\nTheir first official match was held on 30 May 1993 against Swaziland.\r\n\r\nThey qualified for Olympic football for the first time in 2012, and for a FIFA Women's World Cup for the first time in 2019.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Female","strCountry":"South Africa","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/j8czaj1560081821.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"137137","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":null,"intLoved":null,"strTeam":"South Africa Rugby","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1891","strSport":"Rugby","strLeague":"Rugby World Cup","idLeague":"4574","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"www.sarugby.co.za","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"The South Africa national rugby union team, commonly known as the Springboks, is governed by the South African Rugby Union. The Springboks play in green and gold jerseys with white shorts, and their emblems are the Springbok and the King Protea. The team has been representing South Africa in international rugby union since 30 July 1891, when they played their first test match against a British Isles touring team.\r\n\r\nAlthough South Africa was instrumental in the creation of the Rugby World Cup competition, the Springboks did not compete in the first two World Cups in 1987 and 1991 because of anti-apartheid sporting boycotts of South Africa. The team made its World Cup debut in 1995, when the newly democratic South Africa hosted the tournament. The Springboks defeated the All Blacks 15–12 in the final, which is now remembered as one of the greatest moments in South Africa's sporting history, and a watershed moment in the post-Apartheid nation-building process. South Africa regained their title as champions 12 years later, when they defeated England 15–6 in the 2007 final. As a result of the 2007 World Cup tournament the Springboks were promoted to first place in the IRB World Rankings, a position they held until July the following year when New Zealand regained the top spot. They were named 2008 World Team of the Year at the Laureus World Sports Awards.\r\n\r\nThe Springboks also compete in the annual Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri-Nations), along with southern-hemisphere counterparts Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. They have won this championship on three occasions in sixteen years.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"South Africa","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/dfnmb61566381376.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"137150","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"South Africa Cricket","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"1889","strSport":"Cricket","strLeague":"One Day International Series","idLeague":"4801","strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":null,"strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"","strInstagram":"","strDescriptionEN":"The South African national cricket team also known as Proteas (after South Africa's national flower, Protea cynaroides, commonly known as the ‘king protea’), is administered by Cricket South Africa. South Africa is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa entered first-class and international cricket at the same time when they hosted an England cricket team in the 1888–89 season. At first, the team was no match for Australia or England but, having gained in experience and expertise, they were able to field a competitive team in the first decade of the 20th century. The team regularly played against Australia, England and New Zealand through to the 1960s, by which time there was considerable opposition to the country's apartheid policy and an international ban was imposed by the ICC, commensurate with actions taken by other global sporting bodies. When the ban was imposed, South Africa had developed to a point where its team including Eddie Barlow, Graeme Pollock and Mike Procter was arguably the best in the world and had just outplayed Australia.\r\n\r\nThe ban remained in place until 1991 and South Africa could then play against India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the West Indies for the first time. The team since reinstatement has mostly been strong and has at times held number one positions in international rankings but has lacked success in organised tournaments. Outstanding players since reinstatement have included Allan Donald, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock, Jacques Kallis, Graeme Smith, Kagiso Rabada, AB de Villiers, Dale Steyn, Herschelle Gibbs, Faf du Plessis, Imran Tahir and Hashim Amla.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"South Africa","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/4lps321573600745.png","strTeamJersey":null,"strTeamLogo":null,"strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
